# Haiku Generation Using Syllable and Word Count Features with Automated Evaluation
## CSCI544 Final Report

Haiku is a poetry format that originated in 17th-century Japan. Traditional Haiku is written in three separate lines consisting of 5 syllables in the first line, 7 in the second, and 5 in the third. There are other variations and requirements of Haiku, but for consistency, we will be discussing those primarily of the 5-7-5 format just mentioned. Much like AI-generated art, there exist a few generators that can produce Haiku when given data to train. However, these generated Haiku severely lack structure and quality when compared to their human-written counterparts. With the combined efforts of our group, we seek to amend these generators and introduce new concepts in both preprocessing and evaluation for our generation method, hoping to close the gap between human and machine-generated Haiku

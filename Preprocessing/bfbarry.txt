delicate savage  you'll never hold the cinder  but still you will burn 
our destination  the skyline of this city  shining horizon 
a splash and a cry   words pulled from the riverside   dried in the hot sun 
hurt but poised for war  sturdy in crestfallen slumps  warrior spirit 
steamy mist rising  rocks receiving downward crash  as the jungle weeps 
a sultry wine night   spent with a beautiful girl   brash kiss ends smooth jazz 
you were broken glass  but i touched you even though  i knew it would hurt 
say not that i have  fled from the world but that the  world has fled from me 
eyes dance with firelight  the moon and i are lovers  the spiteful sun dies 
i woke up today  i wanted to write a song  i wrote a haiku 
why do you hate me   bored of my dumb brain   tired of this haiku 
know when to quit friend  no time to waste in this space  live well to the end 
if only your luck  had spiked back then in vegas  my life is misfortune 
ritual to relax  has evolved over the time  the effects profound 
gazing upon plains  a loving wind warms my nose  the sun behind me 
the lion limped out  and flipped his tail at march when  fleecy frolicked in 
your words are wounding  your tongue a bloody scalpel  your aim perfection 
time stopped when you spoke   my chest heaved my breath shortened   our candle burnt out 
empty bleeding womb   stark white faces sad eyes say   sorry for your loss 
a sparking of stems  ignited the blazing for  red maple torches 
it ebbs and flows now  my will a rock in the swell  i sink beneath it 
finally they're gone  my chaotic family  now peace and silence 
coming up with poem  takes some consideration  this is the result 
tragedy it seemed  awakening it was though  happiness will come 
always doomscrolling   very stressful times indeed   need someone to lead 
searching the ashes  finding questions unanswered  leaving with charred hands 
your heart is a dead   fortress with walls that swallow   my cries to be free 
dreams of youth  love realized bridged the gaps  forwardeyes raised 
care must be taken  risk always necessary  treading the needle 
dark roof cavity  rodent highway or phantoms  scratch scrape and shuffle 
roses are not red  violets never completely blue  kitty is the one 
i just need some time  for rest and healing and change  i'll get better soon 
river wash my pain  the winds softly sing your name  all flows subliminally 
trump is really bad  he will end america  world war three is real 
she was so broken   he pieced her back together   and broke her himself 
smile forevermore  mother nature will laugh back  now my world is bright 
my first day of cake  what a fabulous feeling  another blue cheese 
real roses have thorns  they teach appreciation  without holding on 
all the bees and trees  won't even briefly lament  human extinction 
i can float away  into the deep dark abyss  welcomed by the stars 
my mind betrays me   each night by dreaming of him   nowhere left to run 
washing the dishes  thinking about a haiku  words flow like water 
prayer at the start  prayer with each twist and turn  prayer filled with thanks 
worms in a circle  circle in the infinite  infinite in the 
waves roll west to east  observed by october trees  echoes of a crow 
dark room and moonlight  fingers reek of nicotine  another cold night 
crystals billowing in an ocean   a fairy guides a herd of pollen   happy frogs croaking 
take a look through me  i'm essentially empty  man the breathing husk 
junkie ghouls linger  near the kmart sepulchre  new necropolis 
she lifts her ass high  where she looks her gaze demands  spank me harder please 
clatter of bottles  and the dense breath of a man  she prays for daylight 
smoke drifts doubt aside   opportunity in hand   another face plant 
small steps to healing  years of damage to repair  i am in no rush 
i lay here in bed  my thoughts full of fear and dread  i wish i were dead 
you take this away  i will destroy your message  god is dementia 
money the force here  drives us and intertwines us  break us from this bond 
obvious artist  no signature required for  landscapes in the fall 
light or dark inside  songbirds sing in the sunshine  owls glide true at night 
i can't get up  elephant on my chest  i can barely breath 
it strange how you can  surround yourself with people  yet still feel alone 
in one swift movement   a heron swallows a fish   and then flies away 
white sands on the beach  and pink petals off a branch  drifting in the wind 
sacramentsyour gift  opened they have all i need  your love so perfect 
my cheeks are sandy   square pants star lives under rock   alaskan bull worm 
trickling water  dense groves of veridian  aged stones half buried 
i wish to send you   a video of a crow   sucks for you i'm blocked 
no one dies today  not inside my influence  and not on my watch 
the calm river flows   branches lurch in the waters   ripples tell the tale 
test of faith  today i will face it  empowered by love 
live your fantasies  your dreams can be memories  just stay out of jail 
what we leave behind  is how we are remembered  plastic is garbage 
a turning point reached  decisions and decisions  to be bold beyond 
you were turned over  rainbow sheened worlds floating free  your bnbbles poured out 
yesterday lit up the sky  when darkness comes  moon will guide you 
i met a poacher  asked him why he liked to kill  just kidding shot him 
hopelessly naive  pining 'til the crack of dawn  my bell never rings 
progress is all gone   i gave into my vices   time to start over 
my grief counselor  was excellent and just died  i don't feel a thing 
contemplating time  for how slow everyday feels  this year ended quick 
words fall short of you   beauty gorgeous not enough   you inspire me 
in love with bundy  death just around the corner  laugh into the sea 
why is it so hard  just to get a job right now  paying living wage 
foot in a puddle  a forgotten parking lot  good place to daydream 
bifurcated hams  just jack off my fag penis  ignore the straight one 
normally i'd sleep  but sleeping won't save me now  not from this heartbreak 
i just kissed a grill  had to prove that i'm not gay  shit i'm gunna puke 
listen she's breathless  look into her bloodshot eyes  should i let go yet 
and when they landed  after waves of fire reigned down  i knew we had lost 
the river bed was  throwing off the cover and  broke the winter quilt 
seething emotions  churning thoughts feelings askew  all i blurt is hi 
will we reconnect    positive thoughts ensure it    we will reconnect 
i searched north to south   despondency was my spoils   rescued by your smile 
a peaceful sunrise  discovers the idle streets  the drunkard blinded 
little by little  exceptions never met  sand slips through my hands 
a secluded place  alone away from all else  i long to live in 
a tap from winter  reminded the cars in a  whirling of petals 
boil these dry leaves  pour the water in my cup  you have spilled the tea 
the empty ink pen  so lonely on my dresser  begs me to use it 
twinkling stars above  like golden fish in a pond  withdrawn swim through time 
letter of request  it is against company  policy to die 
rob really did it  a new city a new job  two holes in the ground 
it has betrayed me  heart pumping eyes wide awake  sleep i summon thee 
beautiful immense  poseidon like the sea  washes o'er my soul 
hidden strength built up  from years of struggle and pain  you are now mighty 
get rid of your junk  and you will finally have  room for your treasure 
this shit just got real  a big promotion ahead  it's mine if i want 
endlessness outweighed  as a feather falls to earth  lifted by the breeze 
vast existence we  god gravity is to be  universal truth 
six months intertwined  tangled bodies under sheets  knot slowly fraying 
i look for shelter   and find a new hiding place   underneath the pines 
two unsteady feet   steel themselves for another   failed attempt to fly 
man and the machine  how are you today but just  spits out a receipt 
hey ups guy  what does that red sticker say  it's fragile dumb dumb 
one on one time wow  each moment so close perfect  once again lord thanks 
today is the day  tomorrow is now today  today is the day 
mercury poisoned  the kid went to therapy  and misdiagnosed 
frost on the river  all boats have been pulled in tight  chicks are home to roost 
a battered housewife  hiding out in her kitchen  prepares tempura 
loosely braided stems  a dainty crown for a queen  small yellow stained hands 
long day in summer   bright sky warm wind yet now   storm is coming 
when you told me that   you had three fewer children   who was sacrificed 
ah bonjour tristesse  i am emotionally  unavailable 
i run far away   nothing but the essentials   keeping my friends safe 
people's dilemma   in the last breath of freedom   thunderous applause 
blood and tears dripping  energy drained passion gained  exist profoundly 
we live in a plague  a time most dire indeed  we will hold the line 
an ancient city  silent sands consume his name  ozymandias 
sometimes it's just there  like a lead weight on your chest  compressing your soul 
weed in the garden  gentle squeeze of the trigger  death of the haiku 
no real purpose here   where is my life going now   fuck i want to die 
shade of a tall tree  becomes a welcoming breeze  breath tranquility 
clear was your anger  stranger how i prayed for you  find the love you seek 
i cannot think straight  i feel alone completely   irreparable 
you're counting the days  segue to weeks months and years  inevitable 
i love you so much  you are the best on the earth  daddy i love you 
i cannot rise see  i am not bread all day long  laying in my bed 
she's a burrito  always getting stuffed so full  get it she cucks me 
communal silence  we all listen together  our creator speaks 
howling wind rattles  the broken summer awning   that broke from the wind 
tired of smart decisions  artificial hapiness  nobody's perfect 
i dreamt i was dead  a dark curtain between sides  i was asleep right 
three in the morning  times ticking by as i scroll  i'm craving for sleep 
joy did it pierce you  love burning our hearts and souls  hope filled my soul 
fellas hangin' out  be my homosexual  just don't tell my wife 
googling symptoms  turns computer off pours wine  no cure for the blues 
gentle ocean tide  the ripple traveled all span  it has reached it's end 
shes an outdoor cat  reminiscing her fifth life  illuminous moon 
defenses are high  positions deeply entrenched  fighting with my boss 
she makes that cough like  pirates on the horizon  already too late 
clouds drop me their time  quarter to soaked in wet dreams  thanks for everything 
window cracked open  hoping for fresh morning air  smells like skunk butt now 
auttum leaves   sigh of relief  be free with me 
dead men sing no songs  but smart conspirators know  silence is a note 
a son of lightning  roots run deep beneath my feet   petals bleached clear white 
life is still quite sweet  even in times of sadness  let me breathe again 
is it possible  to distill out the spaces  and leave just the time 
holes in the wall now  where pretty things used to be  you are still with me 
my happiness is complet  what on earth one more  mustache whisker inhaled 
tiptoeing softly  to lay down near the fire  its old bones now warm 
just as gray clouds burst  and light rains whisper downward  i yawn contently 
its windy again this morning   and everyone i know   will fucking die 
pushed out of the nest   now realizing that i can fly   thank you for leaving 
the weekend was packed   now back to work tomorrow   my life has not slowed 
in the neighborhood  signs divide the red and blue  will this ever end 
fighting a typhoon  relentless i press on but  i can't stand the rain 
this haiku was born  while huckleberry gummies  swam in my belly 
have not been outside  since early february  summer days please stay 
a flower blossoms  uncurls its naked petals  pours in the sun crunch 
paycheck spent on snacks  a belly full of dismay  sweats like fat elvis 
let's get lost tonight  escape the world and we'll find  home in each other 
i should have proposed   you look stunning in your gown  always be happy 
this still feels like home  i have been gone for nine years  time to leave again 
knock knock on the door  little monsters with blue claws  digging for candy 
oil sizzles in the pan  content the stomach rumbles  what joy good food is 
morose until i  make my soul sing a song back  will you forget me 
scurry lurking bird  this sugar is not your life  do not be tempted 
worn faded and stained  the rag dries the artist's brush  it lives its purpose 
full journal pages  flipped to cover yesterday  where do the days go 
you just lost your job  have you friend ever been fired  from your family 
pulling from the front  a fresh toilet paper roll  later from the rear 
a single note plays  the tune linked with piano  push the middle c 
burning unread words  flame consumes your memory  fiercer than our late love 
withering slowly  life paints me with broad brushes  a dead leaf tumbling 
i believe in me  yet i stand in my own way  i will carry on 
a landscape pastiche  smears of blue green and yellow  monet dreamed for me 
coins shook from her hair  in a midas touch with the  leaves changing to gold 
mountain range of clouds  makes the sunrise last longer  gold crown at its peak 
why is it that death  will only lend what life is  compelled to borrow 
fatherhood issues   peed out diaper late at night   have another drink 
social networking  a soapbox for everyone  can we survive it 
my head is burnt out  with all this context switching  try again later 
never connected  nothing makes one feel alone  like that admission 
dancing in the rain  soaked but feeling joyful  i love this moment 
winter's breath so cold  numbing fingers inside gloves  and ears under hats 
am i getting one  asked a man in nantucket  or just giving one 
got a new hoopty  cruising so phat down the block  how much were those rims 
holding on too long   is just fear of letting go  i can't release you 
the writing removed  no body bags to be seen  death of the haiku 
facing my demons  spiritual redemption  freedom to be me 
be kind to yourself  not just in the present but  past and future too 
perfect is the son  perfection of me his will  praise you lord jesus 
my glass is empty  the bathroom tap will not do  kitchen tastes better 
the shine of the moon  and the glimmer of the stars  damn mortality 
the words that i use   have been structured to form a   haiku poem 
haiku is an art   painting landscape dreams of gold   for minds to behold 
message read loud clear  words embrace repulse hard work  in these jobless times 
until the sunrise  moonlit trails ride the ridge line  until the sunrise 
this was a pit stop  a temporary refuge  you were good to me 
left out and denied  never really liked it here  bound to be alone 
say haiku out loud  doesn't it sound like a sneeze  haiku gesundheit 
wound healednow returned  will i be rid of it lord  trusting in our love 
oppressive july  smothering sweaty sleepers  distant thunder mocks 
if this peace is real  let me collect my thoughts quick  then all life is fake 
i love you she says  resting her hand on his heart  afraid he'll wake up 
i couldn't fix you  i had no choice but to run  your demons followed 
here i lie awake  wanting to sleep and thinking  of sleep sweet sweet sleep 
gentle rain falling  the roof sings it's soothing song  sleep comes easily 
i was plummeting  with no parachute no end  but you gave me one 
i feel so carefree  though i am riddled with doubt  a puzzle unsolved 
growth for the sake of  growth is ideology  of the cancer cell 
knew the night was off  hand after hand confirmed this  folded then i left 
please pick up the poop  made a good impression then  flung it off the trail 
songs ever calling  such are the world's temptations  silence needed lord 
the old creaky barn  that once raised a family  is full of spiders 
insulated cold   there is nothing here but cold  encapsulated 
i just bought a duck  not kidding his name's richard  he is fucking cute 
american shores  while canadian neighbors  brood on beaver lodge 
if you don't know what  to do with yourself then do  something for a friend 
standing on the wall   watching the frost ice and snow   winter is coming 
time heals is that true  gears motionless as i watch  the seconds rewind 
sometimes we fall down  sometimes we pick others up  sometimes we move on 
summer betrayal  the cold shoulder of autumn  with jackets for june 
repeat after me  freedom is not found like this  freedom is not found 
left or right click now  left click unless specified  left or right click now 
don't make seas out of  rivers lost in the hourglass  though hardships we face 
blue jeans sunlight air  warm today and i miss you  we'll breathe moonlight soon 
acorn drops from tree  but trees can not produce corn  i am amaized 
the olive branch wakes  no good deed goes unpunished  frost covers its buds 
bad news from every side  depression lurks in the dark   a silent battle 
wishing life away  now near the end of my life  let me start again 
successful con man  still playing by their rules bro   smiles then drive away 
autumn winds arrive  parading through the tree tops  leaf by leaf applause 
in the dead of winter  sleepwalk on my balcony  cold feet in my bed 
staring he stares back  wonders how he became me  then brushes his teeth 
the texas cliche  doesn't fit in the garage  my new manivan 
i miss your presence  all these memories you left  fill me with longing 
falling apart now  holding myself together  faster said than done 
fish and honeybees  see how they are related  butterfly effect 
second vodka in   twilight zone of consciousness   my reality 
floating in stasis  suspended animation  ready to resume 
welcome to the void  drift into black nothingness   time and space dissolved 
better hard to love  than easy to abandon  brutal poetry 
frost on the blood moon   hidden beauty in the sky   her cheek against mine 
van gogh's frightening   clarity was the least he   could say of nature 
ironically so   it is solely beside death   can there exist life 
summertime rain   dusting off muddy tulips  brand new yellow dress 
if you introspect  you may recall your actions  discard assumptions 
the people i knew   whatever happened to them   do they think of me 
home a quiet house  jigsaw pieces fit nicely  sipping my earl gray 
past the coral reefs  disguised on the ocean floor  an octopus waits 
believing in what  birds empty hands sisyphus  my toes in the grass 
hanging on to stars  even tho their light has died  a canyon of screams 
hey up high he says  slap now go down low this time  too slow betrayal 
sights sounds smells routines  comfort but i choose to leave  may i do your will 
i found my purpose  inside the written words of  my innermost self 
there is never enough time  to appreciate  a good burrito 
pause for effect  respect for your weaknesses  some words of wisdom 
fears of your future  become the ghosts of your past  friendly little ghosts 
you can't ask for life  existance forced upon you  it's not free or fair 
life ambidextrous   countin money in my right  slang white by left wrist 
my work kills my soul   why oh why am i here late   come on lucky numbers 
butthole eye puckers  takes one last cigarette drag  incorrigible 
crinkling wrapper  dog instantly in kitchen  hope springs eternal 
when shall spring arrive  winter stays unwelcomed here  smothering all warmth 
so insane lives lost  tears flow hope in mercy love  lord heal our deep wounds 
busy bee busy  buzzing between blooming bulbs  burden but bounty 
watching the leaves fall   waiting for the first snowfall   wishing for summer 
the falling rain stops   in its passing memory   reflection of sky 
the water submits  victory without defeat  beautiful laughter 
good night good night all  parting my way to sorrow  til it be morrow 
sweet sharp saudade  the hair ties lie silently  my furry best friend 
three in the morning  i'm up reading strange comments  reddit lullaby 
was wishing today   was tomorrow and sorrow  had wings and would fly 
keep your trash and change   in the same pocket for they   are one and the same 
campfire set aglow  embers soar past moon soaked pines  dusk cricket's opus 
down these wooden steps  leaves crunch under dusty boots  steep this hiking trail 
how can a movie  about sex and bondage  be so damn boring 
the big bang  unfinished pattern still unfolds  illusion of freedom 
the wind writes poems  scrawls curving brushstrokes of snow  and reads them aloud 
no taco today  mondays will not be the same  broken paradigm 
sleep is resourceful   she turns tables to pillows   during maths exams 
she paints my skies blue  she is my sun and my moon  she's my everything 
warm star wakes early   gentle breeze tickles the grass   birds chirp reverie 
your joy warmed my heart  prayers answered once again  humbly i give thanks 
adrift between states  diesel cuts through mountain air  spark drag breath home 
fear can cripple you  prevent you from advancing  proceed anyway 
my love for you is  like the waves in the ocean  deeply eternal 
each night he enters  each night he plays the same song  each night a nightmare 
creating something  not sure what yet still so new  but i will create 
that last episode   gave me more faith in mankind   great writing westworld 
be free and let go   to realize you are human   you will make mistakes 
scurrying nurses  evacuate larvae when  he stepped on their roof 
we must embrace change  because it is the only  certainty we have 
across an ocean   where the clouds meets the water  the horizon waits 
betrayal burns the most  hearts of those who trusted wrong  scraping away hope 
i ate the corner  chocolatey as it was  the party pooper 
my bones shatter   my energy leaves me   ache and break 
uniquely special  completely one of a kind  individual 
what is there to do  other than sit around and   eat food eat food eat 
he looks familiar  a slow smile spreads on my lips  my lover is back 
wise men pick battles  the winds pick seeds and cotton  laying on the ground 
leaves that were once green  slowly fade into orange  cold wind chill the air 
we found each other  in a rapid eye movement  reality gone 
it was falling hard  when i stood in a purple coat  watching the cement drown 
the yews are sulking  snow tipped and bent to the ground  my life is exposed 
worriesi have them  worriestrusting in god's grace  worriesdissolving 
today i'm with you   tomorrow i am not sure   no regrets that's life 
bird feeder reflects  sunlight between passing clouds  flitting wings shadows 
childhood fadingtears  love i offer for these days  never will it fade 
for a moment there  i believed this was true love  oh you thought the same 
solifuges shrink  into lizards in ancient  smashing black zeroes 
time is as humbling   as the wound we left to heal   a blood soaked bandage 
the light from our star  reflections of a bright night  light from our moonlight 
crowning his head with  vanity and beguile had  also crucified 
want to make mistakes  and burn down the orphanage  and wake up sorry 
froze to the core  shifting breaking ever more  broken ever more 
creeping discomfort  when i'm not without  unmanaged feelings 
i want to believe   in thelma to my louise   or laverne shirley 
a gentleman swung  his steel arm in courtesy  to his pivot bridge 
oh zero zero  how negative that is  pee stain on my jeans 
transient flowers  beauty trapped permanently   never to wither 
that worried old man  waits by his empty mailbox  for something for snow 
testing spoiler text   this may be deleted soon   wasting precious time 
we're already much more   than casual or small time   baby this is it 
even though i miss you  i find myself crying less  bittersweet emptiness 
midnight summer breeze  cup of tea  so serene   a simple life  i smile 
journal life daily    distraction or otherwise    unforgettable 
i'm ready for bed  she told me as she hung up  she didn't mean mine 
what is a raindrop  but a single metaphor  for my fall to earth

she hands him her heart  he considers it and then  feeds it to the dog 
i feel like a fraud   but kind comments clear the fog   imposter syndrome 
in grease coveralls  oblivious to his looks  while her engine purred 
bathe in sadness  tears welling shivers seeking warmth  chilling winds prevail 
dewdrops on black grass  my thumb collects the river  wipe her tear away 
yellow flowers sky high  black bird darts past a tree  haiku on hand needs edit 
four hours gone by  laughter in the waiting room  twice now an uncle 
my better judgement   says this is a mistake but   i welcome you back

warm skin and soft hearts  a half smoked spliff and cheap beer  lazily in love 
driving home from work  squirrel runs out in front of me  make furry road kill 
happily watching  esl students butcher  american songs 
on summer solstice  a triumph of fireflies  rising in the rain 
sometimes i think that  i've worn out a welcome i   never truly had 
expression unseen  no response is forthcoming  yet i am relieved 
you'd think i would learn  you wait for things to cool down  before you touch them 
that feeling when you  fall in love with your bestfriend  that shit hurts the heart 
pride distracts misleads  humbly i pray for god's grace  slowly i am changed 
a dead man walking   the earth breathes and yearns for him   light escapes the void 
an identity  you assigned to me now who  am i without you 
in a hot work day  it starts raining out of blue   we smile getting wet 
a calming haze blooms  gentle sky clears for sunshine  spring blossoms sweetly 
like the wind you run  wild free and fearless you move  i shall be your guard 
once upon a time  us together safe and sound  in a distant past 
had too much caffeine  bouncing around til i crash   tired but happy 
does it appeal to  you that the social milieu  is all a true ruse 
i don't feel a thing  when i most need to be loved  i'm always alone 
glances behind her  how did i get so lucky  i hope he keeps up 
stuck in this wet grass  i seem to have found myself  in a quagmire 
bang zoom  fireworks red whites and blue   kids in cages 
i'll take care of you   when you eat i'll go hungry   who takes care of me 
the clouds will not move  until you stop watching them  whats your problem man 
flame spreads throughout home  the screams permeate the night  i proceed to weep 
grief is an old barn  cold musty air and shadows  of abandoned tools 
sipping on alcohol  heart throbbing through my body  feeling wonderful 
the stars are smeared red   the old ones arrive   our very last sunrise 
dislocated jaw  should not have blown that centaur  i'd do it again 
remember those days  thought they would never end right  yes but joynew days 
if i ever smiled  it has mixed with the raindrops  unwashable stain 
cascades of her hair  laughter in the house we share  my favorite sound 
what matters to me  no dollar sign can measure  passion over pay 
all the signs say stop  why does my heart keep going  we know how this ends 
when you know yourself  the world is for your taking  live your potential 
you never loved me  did you love stealing my heart  leaving it broken 
your holy spirit  always filling me with grace  how awesome my lord 
hear bats in the trees  i think of hungry vampires  day is dark as night 
reserved for speaker  a robin's oratory  gave a trilling speech 
hawking said black holes  spill radiation but how  probably magnets 
my heart is heavy  so much suffering these days  when will the pain end 
i'm breaking apart  putting myself together  will take a long time 
four beige walls surround  coughing chatter long white noise  no more sense of time 
the sky is so blue  and happy looks so good on you   thank you universe 
in limpid silver  she shines bright amongst the stars  down here a dog barks 
i know that it's hard  i'm the invisible friend  always here for you 
i message you you   don't respond dunno which of  us two is the 'ghost'

illuminated  by his love in the meadow  each flower head turned 
you won't know the name  no seriously you won't  it's someplace somewhere 
a chance to explain  my intentions poorly guessed  misunderstanding 
i'm learning to walk  without shackles on my feet  yet i still stumble 
always sad to see  someone upset taking down  missing pet posters 
age changes us all  lusting after memory  illusions gone by 
knife twisting cancer  taking never replacing  killing with malice 
did i do this right  i'm not very creative  haikus are real hard 
got indian food  to weaponize my asshole  filthy kurds beware 
cicadas cries  washes out dark fears  moon shines on 
unwilling to try  no one is coming for you  please don't give up now 
a drop of water  emptiness is falling  chiliocosms end 
r slash haiku ha  more like r slash no thank you  ammi right uptop 
the fourth of july  proves we really give no fucks  about pollution 
tranquil moonlit pond  lone frog on a lotus leaf  sings his summer song 
the fire will discern  burns away impurities  sticks in my pocket 
my birth was abrupt  snow falls even on the ocean  if the time is ripe 
poetry isn't mine   the skill required eludes me   but i'll keep trying 
written haiku can  be a knife slicing through our  human existence 
scapegoat is sought  select me if you must  my love remains 
the wind carved the stone  polished smooth it has no cracks  but no other shape 
this is a haiku  but it has nothing to say  mogami river 
clear blue skies washed white  leaves rustled along the path  hypnotized demise 
the eternal rose   the glass rose is beautiful  but lacks warmth lacks life 
rise above the gloom  see the light the warmth the love  now take a deep breath 
forgot to brush teeth  no worse feeling that can beat  when breath smell like feet 
plastic men follow  black suits sunglasses sharp shoes  these are giveaways 
death threats and screaming   a cacophony of hate   people just be nicer 
nothingness awakens  first mirror first reflection  first sight first bedhead 
beehives seek nectar  golden liquid melts to thought  mead of poetry 
rusted bludgeoning  iambic breaking the skull  metric tons of blood 
my mind is a cave  where thoughts of her with him  echo in my head 
slaughtered strands of lives  fade away to obscure  feeding the machine 
the moons cast shadows  awaken the trees' auras   connecting the souls 
expected a setback  instead a goal was attained  thank you lord 
dusk of a lifetime  your love and familiar huff  our tears reminisce 
well written haikus  transport you to other worlds  alas not this one 
bought a nice new car  when all i want to do is  buy a nice new cat 
between man and beast  crucial distinction is lost  when blood is scented 
it's nice to be here  don't let the bugs eat my head  i can see the clouds 
too shy to ask you  if the feelings are mutual   can we get closer 
midwest slow livin   factory jobs and cornfields   trying to get by 
sitting upon hill  towering above my problems  blades of grass my friends 
i want to feel joy   so i won't indulge my thirst   sit still with my void 
emerald valley  rainbow dewdrops catch the sun  diamonds none can grasp 
you should be thankful  i haven't woken up yet  you're safe in my dream 
the moon and the sun  an eternal cosmic dance  how great to witness 
the ground is beaten  with children's feet  the soil remains silent 
how real do you get   when you have killed your own mom   and nobody cares 
this fire between us  smouldering with every step  i think it's the clap 
sweaty sleepless nights  spent pacing in blue lit rooms  insomnia woes 
the tiny dragon  your soft breathing soothes my soul  sleep well little prince 
house full of big dogs  what's there to complain about  no room on the couch 
come hither efforts  with lingerie and perfume  dream of little feet 
had another day  longing to become myself  over under tie 
how can god touch me  where the crumbling pieces are  bathing them in light 
haiku collection  written by assorted teens  cuz school is boring 
memories are lost  leaves fluttering on the wind  autumn overwhelms 
cycling through my mind   a bicycle with one wheel   cannot take you far 
if the gods were to  intervene there could be no  free will so they're still 
the bearer of life  with unconditional love  this day is for you 
a sea of concrete   stretching to the horizon   flowers in the cracks 
why must you suffer  answers hidden from us all  i trust you jesus 
gaze in the mirror   it looks like it's been shattered   but the glass is smooth 
dead aristocrats  empty victorian house  is future goth malls 
just one little duck  wading along the canal  where's the family 
fairy wings flutter  tickle her ears as she walks  down their secret path 
i seem to be lost  but there's no destination  i guess i'm okay 
as i swab the deck  homosexual anal  'tis but piracy 
the soldiers look up  as two eagles fight and fall  a sign from the gods 
in the vast cosmos  if we all learn the cosmos  we still know nothing 
summer solstice knocks  stonehenge waits to cast shadows  early dawn to come 
silent empty bed  your frame dancing in my head  but the musics stopped 
it is late at night  i am on my computer  i should get more sleep 
long awaited tea  you fill my soul with your warmth  this winter is long 
support the people  that live with risk all the time  their needs dwarf your wants 
kids play on a swing  pray they will wake from their dream  and find each other 
one in thirty six  combinations i could hit  always snake eyes 
i am you  you are everyone  everywhere 
ah fuck fuck shit fuck  aaa my balls fuck oh god my  balls oh it hurts oh 
what is a haiku  five seven and five  rhyming not needed 
you just want the sex  i'm not the guy you will love  every time the same 
world keeps getting tight  soul needs fuel to reignite  then i say i might 
black banished you out   did i do it correctly   only time will tell 
on a sandy beach  people playing everywhere  great relaxation 
it's very simple  to not be thought as racist  don't do racist things 
i sit beneath an oak  cradled low between high roots  leaves scattering sunlight 
ash is my shadow   i wanted to quote rilke   please add up my sin 
perhaps in falling  i'm also gaining the speed  to fly by myself 
she said follow me  all days in a pewter daze  on the shore coasting 
oppressive stillness   unrelenting stagnation   nothing left to do 
i have hair down there  in my special place of love  it is prickly sharp 
the mind of buddha  without beginning or end  clouds pass through the sky 
falling through the air  diving through the concrete ground  melting in the earth 
endless sea of souls  how much deeper must i sink  until i find mine 
those tears became mine  those smiles lifted my spirit  lives ever entwined 
i wrote a haiku   in the shower but now i've   went and forgot it 
i was on my way   when i saw him on the side   my purpose then changed 
pencils fragile they  paint ideas into tristesse  only lead by muse 
do not doubt yourself  you are my personal truth  i believe in you 
cold nights warmth in dreams  cold days warmth in your greeting  cold endured this day 
the silence of dawn  haze thick on the horizon  delights of the sun 
what's with the concern  chew me up and spit me out  i am used to it 
roses that are red   here a nice poem for you   oh it's a haiku 
a lone butt nugget  adrift on foreign ocean  sailing in the breeze 
be an animal  not destructive but peaceful  live in the moment 
last days of winter  a dog howling under  the blossoming pears 
starry skies alone  i ruminate my future  where do i go now 
unlocking the door  a thief had stolen in and  stolen paradise 
brown carpet of leaves  death scattered to be absorbed  feeding leaves of green 
even in the south  hearing lonesome whipoorwhils  i long for the south 
still as sun rises  regardless of time  we sit zazen 
the more the cold bites  the more the freezing wind cuts  the more my heart burns 
fill your shoes with booze  you are now a rum runner  your sloshed galoshes 
leaves fall every year  few souls takes any notice  as their eyes are closed 
eat too much sphaget  tomatoes you will regret  my insides hurt now 
cut the vein and feed   drink the red blood of my soul   poetry you vampire 
carpet crop circles  all that remains of her here  that and bobbypins 
this coming future  all i know is here and now  fleeting memory 
he wanted greatness   but lived in the liner notes   forever unknown 
even unicorns  such a beautiful creature  get eaten by bears 
do not fall in love  the landing isn't worth it  better to be safe 
this is a haiku  there's nothing better to do  than write a haiku 
attached to the past  living to plan the future  existing here now 
a child of janus  a bipolar pendulum  i'm me then i'm me 
put this collar on  and give yourself up to me  let me set you free 
use a fine rum that  you would like to drink  wht are we baking a cake then 
hail falls from the sky   like a painful truth revealed   hurts when you get hit 
temptation wraps you  in the blanket of pleasure  but blows off in storms 
a nice gentle breeze  interrupted by mudslide  i sharted again 
camaraderie  good people long rides music  i miss traveling 
you only see one  but there are six more within  my fragmented mind 
lonely asian man   nobody buy his noodles   stupid pathogen 
so disenchanted   that running away is home   to wake is a dream 
i am bored as hell   just waiting for the weekend   time for camping ya'll 
captain's log stardate  in a diverse universe  we found we are one 
strips of tortillas  lightly fried then add salsa  simmer serve with cheese 
the windy section  conducted by the maestro  blowing in the march 
life fashioned in love  loved even in the dark times  hope fueled by faith 
softly they embrace   two vines woven together   love deeply rooted 
silence is broken  cracking splash splintered bodies  an iceberg drifting 
the springtime is here  cherry trees on cherry st  best time of the year 
beside me are you  each moment lived together  guiding perfecting 
man eats lunch dog sits   thinking scraps might come his way   the life of a dog 
panic must buy food  tp cans coughing oh no  got you in the store 
big vintage t shirts  and bigger city sunsets  make up the small things 
nameless vehicles   telephone poles and wires  industrial smoke 
memories once sweet  now black and crusted to the  brain like yam drippings 
pink contrails slice through  the pale blue sky of morning  hinting at sunrise 
seven moonlit crows  perched along a barbed wire fence  with no will to fly 
don't search for the words   when you have nothing to say   silence is golden 
i thought i liked it  the feeling of loneliness  but who do i tell 
already my heart  was hibernating when the  snows of winter fell 
embers spark the brush   endangering the forest   leaving ashen scars 
truth transcends space time  interplanetary truth  truth might not exist 
only good intentions  the only bad intention  having to many 
once you held my hand  adrift in your fearless gaze  we will meet again 
slipped under the tide  the waves crashing nostalgia  suddenly drowning 
the cityscape shifts   when i remove my glasses   the stars stay the same 
screaming everywhere  no one but me can hear it  auditory ghosts 
there once was a man  from cork who got limericks  and haikus confused 
chalk marks on the wall  drop knee crimp gaston heel hook  overcoming fears 
morning ritual  a mouse under the new moon  sleepy eyes calm breath 
who is that woman  the riddle of the model  i want to know her 
do not aspire  to bloom flowers or take root  moss respires too 
your love gave me wings   i took flight like icarus   my ego our doom 
thinking of coffee  has me dreaming in the night  can't wait for breakfast 
sleeping in monday   lets sad thoughts into the mind   leaves bad taste in mouth 
we both dreamt up love  and on us each drew our dreams  a mix of nightmares 
anonymously  enters the public toilet  looks both ways no one 
i made a big fart  it woke me from a deep sleep  then i could not sleep 
if she really cared  i would already be there  desire laid bare 
sometimes it is true  i simply don't sort by new  therefore i'm sorry 
three months left to live  last trip to eat his pancakes  shirt soaked with her tears 
i count down the days  to finally leave this place  i used to call home 
staring at your face  now i know what life is for   greatest gift of all 
only time can heal   the notion that we're alone   find peace within you 
in each momentyou  for me such love and service  humbly i say thanks 
carousing crows are  blackening backyards with an  october outing 
typing a message  i'm thinking of you at work  put that phone away 
do my past wounds see  the scarred skin they left behind  protecting me now 
life is infinite   this is a good piece of news   worse that it's bounded 
forever slowly drowning  under the water  nobody saw the struggle 
my hand on your throat   my lips brush against your ear   you belong to me 
traces by talon  an explosion of feathers  shredded from a jay 
the squeak of dry snow  is only experienced  on the coldest nights 
feels claustrophobic  induce asphyxiation  theatre for venom 
suddenly a loss  sadness penetrates covers  find hope in god's love 
whiskey on my breath  i've been tasting it for days  while wild flowers bloom 
the bread magician  lowered in a metal box  popping out it's toast 
forgiveness is earned   self deceit is living death   honor is guiltless 
some haiku for you  to show how one mayhaps do  i hope you enjoy 
i loved him fully  but he is never present  time to let him go 
stumbling falling ouch  such pain your hand thanks we walk  following your lead 
when writing haikus  fingers tap on surfaces  counting syllables 
i'd bleed myself dry  and rename the stars for you  just to kiss you once 
always perfect love  poured out for me every day  thanks be to god joy 
from you deception  grace will lead me to the truth  wisdom in the word 
my dearest hello  a cycle of 'come and go'  this time please stay 
such trash tier anal  the limpness of this wino  a bloody disgrace 
in darkest spaces  her dull pain led to closure  a freakin' dance off 
whatchoo wanna do  make me wanna shoop baby  you make me wanna 
the lineman hooked his  rope and hung by a thread to  repair his webbing 
she wore a perfume   to the concentration camp   like an ugly rose 
driftwood floats away  drunken eyes fail to focus  on the wooden step 
well i was clearly  into that more than you were  one lives and one learns 
empty bottle gone  something is extremely wrong  nothing left to be 
deft finger tips seek  where hidden sweet agony lies  awaiting release 
potato rosti  a lot of work for not much  best just make wedges 
meadows i long for   sun bathing with a nice breeze   i miss the outdoors 
her frantic search was  clinging to a dryer sheet  for the orphan sock 
under the palm trees  faded mountains behind us  the earth stops spinning 
refurbishing brain  in the fork of neuron cell  smile's algorithm 
the white light pentrates unhesitantly  through the dark clouds eclipsing the horizon   a day's final farewell 
long dead moon   remains are hollow   bobbing corpse 
many spiders weave  during warm summer evenings  grandma on the porch 
the world at first site  the mind is cast into life  never to know truth 
peering inside  mother's old purse  the cool dark air 
ford focus rs  speeding down the mountain pass  must be late for work 
if one feels the need  for piles of toilet paper  one is full of shit 
positivity  cannot conquer anything  action is required 
whisky at sunrise  events will unfold  total destruction 
freeze said the botox  to criminal wrinkles and  arrested a face 
memories morphed today  celebrating newrecalling the charm  gap creatively filled 
fleeting feelings of want  traverse my flaming conscience  now they're gone again 
turn up the tv  so the delivery man  thinks i'm not alone 
surprised filled with joy  what i sought given to me  so perfectthank you 
the promise of spring  cherry blossoms bloom brightly  a lie cold frost strikes 
winters cold entrail  stealing life from the living  triggering new birth 
the lunar beauty  on earth and in the heavens  your light shines brighter 
leaves step to music  wind plays as an orchestra  directing their dance 
if you are in doubt   then just believe in the me   who believes in you 
her song is sweetest  her hum resonates in man  her name is the sea 
the trail to the peak  softened by the winter rains  remains on my boots 
it was the best of  rhymes it was the worst of rhymes  this haiku got meta 
sweat trickles slowly  the clouds give us some respite  didn't take the job 
a maze in my mind   one way out hidden away   only hope to guide 
the thirteen angels  with mud and dirt pull my body  and mold my angles 
trying to write  the words glaring back at me  knowing they are lies 
peering through windows  internal needs shrouded by  chimerical wants 
dandelion stalk  alone it sways triumphant  over a still lawn 
nighttime stroll alone  windows spill enchanted light  jasmine are in bloom 
cold dew on the leaf  if you knew my loneliness  what help could you give 
mind ruminating  angrily switch sides in bed  smile and pet cat 
inclement dawning  an active server falters  denial of service 
when the ash settles  and the darkest sun shines dull  you'll have a nice lunch 
the past still haunts me   visions and nightmares i see   when will i be free 
vessel in my head   a tempest in the ocean   threats to sink my ship 
dark and rainy days  are the best i grab my catto  and pet him to sleep 
regal red birds chirp  grandma's favorite callers  my link to the past 
something like a dream   lost in the stars of your eyes   that brought be back to older days 
storm clouds brew ahead  sunlight breaks the sky open  a bright disaster 
the accusations  a black cloud i cannot shake  chase me to the death 
when i learned to talk  my hands wave for your ears but  you could not hear me 
peace found in the chores  giving thanks to you this day  lord your grace my joy 
if i had not seen  the flower would not have been  that much beautiful 
erogenous zone  found within a few seconds  the back of your ear 
i've been down this road  yeah yeah this one really sucks  it's got a dead end 
i long to hear you  your whispers are a sweet song  your words like fine wine 
people divided   are we going to survive this  yes if we choose love 
starving in the woods  a man found energy plant  never came back home 
i'm the growing seed  i don't lose identity  forever changing 
dark sunlight   from within a cloud   evenin strolling about 
a flurry of words  beckon for my attention  which ones will i chhoose 
a sunset mane gallops free  eyes of lavender  wind in the sunset tastes sweet 
dreamt a dream so real  a penny clenched tight to keep  wide eyed empty fist 
the stars are abode   to sky deities aloft  pure imagination 
towering redwoods  ancient keepers of knowledge  deafening silence 
i'll pen a murder  console your heart through blood lust  seal this ink black pact 
as you walked past me   i can smell honeysuckle   a bittersweet scent 
orange auburn red  piled like snow on curbs cars  damp autumn blanket 
i'm very hungry  but am having to much fun  video games starve 
what one wants in life  versus what one needs to do  can vary widely 
behind me follows  the breeze sings a message  carry me away 
the open book stares  its blank pages search my soul  i cannot write it 
watching old cat sleep  fed her by bottle when young  i love you gato 
sometime this morning  the rows of green gave birth to  pink and white blossoms 
all of my atoms  each one a conscious being  what is a person 
featherlight headed  thick white flavored smoke plumes from  tall shisha towers 
it is a struggle  whenever i have nightmares  no one to snuggle 
oh yeah this is fast  this is too fast i can't stop  flying through the air 
i hear his smile  three thousand seven hundred  across and miles 
in twilight's embrace  my heart skips a beat for you  nightfall in your eyes 
treasures memories   everyone keeps something  flame peace the score 
you have potential  it grows and wanes as time moves  use it while you can 
their serpent was pulled  back into the sea and had  dissolved in the sand 
sardines and tuna  dinner was yummy tonight  and now kitties poop 
poo pee poo pee poo  i might be too old for this  but you might be too 
give time for a dime  for few to make a dollar  makes the world holler 
worker bees can leave  even drones can fly away  the queen is their slave 
the meaning of life  revealed on a tanker truck  find a need fill it 
the old try to buy  what they spent their youths selling  a market for soul 
empty bench just there  for a weary traveller  yet to need a rest 
hometown funeral  driving back a railway wreck  something in common 
beneath a willow  beside a flowing river  basks a severed tongue 
i smiled as you danced   beneath the venetian moon   hands clutching roses 
a tropical storm  summer in san francisco  no longer winter 
you went to afghan  you came back to kentucky  but part of you stayed 
cheese is always good   gouda brie monterey jack   colby swiss yummy 
koi in a small pond  the ducks screaming in warning  a heron wants fish 
the heart and vases   it's as if it was a rule   made to be broken 
critics and eunuchs  both can observe and comment  but neither can do 
hands are hollow  yet i live with no worries  accepting the stresses 
petal in the hand  rose naked before the eye  life gone forever 
did all i can do  spring flowers wilt in the heat  he's gone sailed away 
absent unspoken  memories filling the void  dreams of reunion 
dead fish watches me  people leaving grocery store  spring already had breakfast 
your words are wounding  your lying tongue a scalpel  your aim perfection 
sunshine warmtha walk  blue sky birds people new hope  steps on this journey 
mean bear poison snake   bitten thrice watch out stupid  not here nevermore 
across the expanse  turquoise mountains and summits  all within the bath 
life has a meaning  its what you want it to be  too many options 
ross rachel joey  chandler monica phoebe  who's your favorite friend 
just as easy as   i fell for you we quickly   then just fell apart 
day dreaming of him   my hands on his back softly   yearing is lonely 
sweet embrace of death  do not stray away from me  end my misery 
coming together  in this moment we are one  synchronised heart beat 
in the end she came  just a lifetime of waiting  soundly i sleep now 
his flashing light dimmed  in the sticky hit and run  tearing from the web 
as the turkey flies  new decorations arise  leads the seasons' change 
people raff at me  because i am diffelent  but i raff at them 
winter crescent moon  chalice tipped by the mother  cold drops of sweet dew 
delicate lace edge  contrasted against your skin  my body prepares 
gently bows her head   golden hair down the shoulder   violet's blue eyes 
on october third  it's a quote from a movie  he asked me the date 
faith can be tested  and it will sometimes fail  but it will return 
i am an evil man  i steal candy from babies  is that really bad 
i cried tears of rage  and then it began to rain  nature felt my pain 
shoulder to the wheel  perpetuating the cycle  of casks and caskets 
the future's opaque  the past poorly remembered  only every now 
down under the dirt  they crawl and fight to survive   they will soon will find life 
feed the birds today  the young ones are so hungry  their nests are so bare 
these knotted shoulders  flaky scalp and stinging eyes  i must quit my job 
the sun shines outside  yet the air is thick with dread  a storm brews within 
schedule time for you  shower shave brush read cook knit  don't sink just don't sink 
what is my work worth  labor is my distraction  in a futile race 
rain quietly falls  dry ground grows muddy and wet  leaving petrichor 
bottomless sea of rage   daily struggle to reach the surface   their love a temporary raft 
although i am young  it feels as if my lifetime  has reached its autumn 
clicking and tapping  fluorescent glow overhead  another work day 
ouch the pan is hot  oh my god i burned my hand  i need a towel 
together we climbed  together we shared prayed loved  together today 
hazy memories  like an ancient fairytale  in the deep ocean 
you were but a dog  but my only friend in this life  i miss you so much 
tears and sweat and blood  together they form despair  i am just human 
it's all about rights   till coffins start piling up   in underground parks 
tasering a dog  returning to your love by  turning up the shock 
words at your behest  you must be interesting  probably not well hung 
stoned and daydreaming  of the next time i see you  it's making me smile 
once a hunter strong  now a prisoner of night  cruel and moonlit 
a haiku a day  keeps mental monsters at bay  less another way 
the pond where i fish   frogs come out under the moon   springs nightly concert 
hi i'm joe exotic  they call me the tiger king  fuck carole baskin 
sighing heavily  running around in circles  chasing a dead end 
what am i doing  driving all this way for what  it's self sabotage 
weeping skies  pure water cleansing  it can't clean me 
failure  brings pain and hurt  like a bee's sting 
really miss your voice  and the way you make me smile  i love you so much 
i need a bottle   i don't care about your sleep  go get my bottle 
like life is for real  when you've got these groceries  and they all just spill 
her moans of heaven  labored uncontrollably  burn hell to white ash 
coronavirus   testing our humanity  be compassionate 
disappears past sweet  acrid olfactory hit  who knows what happened 
wild daffodils bloom  turkeys gobble out their lust  kentucky spring time 
here i stand alone  my heart is cold like winter  darkness consumes me 
downloading conscience  in the confessional for  a freedom upgrade 
wind crisp on my face  silver crescent bright as day  midnight by moonlight 
nostrils flutter rage  is your name mine is pity  hope you will find peace 
spellbound envious  an unwanted audience  get your own pizza 
closed door no sunlight  clocks ticking with frozen time  home awaits me still 
one lonely morning  small spider out my window  gone when the rain comes 
i can't get to sleep  it's been almost two days now  someone please kill me 
absence grays the day  hope breaks up the gloom with love  aching for your light 
become the parent  you wanted as a child  sink into yourself 
i saw a spider  the great chicago fire  the spider's gone now 
i write down the words  but the feelings don't come through  i crumple my work 
many thoughts interlace  curious for male and female  alas feel peace now 
cold dark house your lips  these days i think unbelieved  stained table cloths today 
stuck at a crossroad   i don't know which way to pick   a hard decision 
i ate some dairy  and now i am suffering  the consequences 
forlorn figures in   desolated dark areas   waiting to be found 
i only wanted  a commemorative plate  regards salome 
psychologists  manage expectations  but fail to heal 
something i have learned  masochism is real  more pain means less guilt 
i draw on my pipe  late evening by the willows  autumn moon rising 
stuck my head  into a tree  crown of leaves 
growth is not easy  it is painful and staggered  unpredictable 
laptop lid closes  nobody there to observe  as silence endures 
each day i wake up  lonely trying to forget  the things i regret 
there is no menu  and you get what you deserve  in restaurants called karma 
had a nice thought once  i ruined it when it got  mixed in with the darks 
no new messages   the unbearable silence   pick phone up again 
insurmountable  silence a wall between us  a ghost in the night 
whispering willows  speaking of times long sense past  memories remain 
i must spend my time  whether i want to or not  there are no receipts 
in isolation  solitude becomes a poem  that kisses my lips 
one sole stone pebble  tumbling down a steep cliff side  changes history 
just think about it   we are all gathered here for   our love for haiku 
results omitted  beware the streisand effect  forget me google 
imagining such moments  gives such joy and hope  dreams of eternity 
clouds are the gray gates  opened by the bright sun  brings the turquoise sky 
gullible string theory   and dimensions unsung   meet in plank lengths 
rapture the landscape   solitude my damnation   content in silence 
bliss just beyond grasp  so close i could almost taste  welcome to my hell 
i cut off his hand  pleading i reveal the truth  i am you father 
battle intellect  i didn't offend you yet  how mad can you get 
overprotective  no sense of independence   smother me with love 
plutonic city  hubble could barely see it  kuiper ships waiting 
my fire is out now  was it ever truly lit  will i ever thaw 
a traveller's life  roaming here wandering there  here and there is home 
for the times you fall  may someone be there to see  and pick you back up 
rainy mountain path  travelled by all in their life  home lays at it's end 
soft retreating sun  colors of the leaves have changed  so too does my heart 
let's count together  and list every number  from zero to one 
salt stains on suede shoes  sweaters soaked by swirling snow  withering weather 
if you want to be  then let your spirit exclaim  i am here for you 
images of sorrow  life with joy and suffering  your love inspires 
mcdonald's rest rooms  hold no rest for the wicked  doesn't bother me 
the pine tree is tall   the pine tree stands in the wind   the pine tree is all 
goals as a father  teach please and thank you also  don't fuck with people 
promise you'll find me  her small hand squeezed her mother's  the train whistle blew 
a sheet of concrete  imagination prison  this white empty page 
persistent warning  many months to deter it  imminent meltdown 
unacknowledged worth  seductive blasphemy lures  empty promises 
power to choose fate  destiny ahead of them  making the right choice 
sickeningly sweet  the lingering taste of you  sugar on my lips 
alone in this night  the streets are silent and still  no direction home 
in a golden pond   the coy and carp splash around   such a joyous sight 
morning comes gently   the day leads to disaster   night becomes mourning 
a twilight ringing  my telemarket mistress  a free cruise for two 
what is happening   i do not even know bro   this is fucked up 
late night intrusion  my heart races sweaty palms  does she think of me 
sumo takes cold bath   holes with small lines grow bigger   ice fishing in spring 
it's stuck in my head  toss a coin to your witcher  damn that's a good song 
everything you do  sparkles so brightly sometimes  i can't even look 
you call him monster   so he chose to become one   you call me fascist 
i look at your face  and catch you looking at me  your eyes are sparkling 
don't put pants on me   my willy should be all free   all should gaze on me 
the neon district  a lightning bug wink while they  solicit a mate 
find the rest of me  backstreets subterranean  tunnels under sheets 
white guy black bar  white guy black bar white guy black  fat lips on my cock 
i barely noticed  i came within one meter  of my final act 
i've fallen for you  but i don't want to get up  it feels nice down here 
a blue spruce fiat  invited the little bird  to nest in her bough 
the morning light breaks  a rose petal floats to earth  i look to the sky 
time for a road trip  cruising with the window down  oh no it's raining 
smiling at them now  all the rough edges blurry  i won't forget you 
i am there for you  are you sure you're not just sad  maybe try to smile 
my beds not the same  missing subtle ambience  after you wake up 
this feels so good now  but give it a day or two  you'll hate yourself then 
pale sweet strawberry  your soft hair against my chest  brings me so much ease 
copper dust scatters  below the descending craft  perseverance lands 
so then i ask you  what does one do when true love  grows wings of its own 
who i am today  not who i am tomorrow  sleep away my drive 
black friday online  do i need all this garbage  i'm not quite that cheap 
i have insomnia  what is the cells powerhouse  a mitochondria 
themeanstoanend  completioncontemplation  thenasweetrelease 
monsoon has arrived  i can hardly see the road  you sleep through the rain 
a client meeting  dress blows open in the wind  wrap dress betrayal 
today i found you  reaching out to renew us  memories erupt 
he stands on the edge  two paths lay clearly ahead  but instead he sits 
the little river  that splashes in the sunlight  is so loud at night 
what we leave behind  is how we are remembered  leave fond memories 
this wind makes no sound   silence isn't this quiet   i am dead to you 
with or without guac  some tortillas meat and cheese  let's eat some nachos 
views i chase up hills  i must remember looking  back is breathtaking 
fresh wounds on old scars  unwashed monarchs still wrestle  blood is love but lost 
you like flats or drums  hot and spicy or just mild  gotta have them wings 
will i ever stop  feeling like an impostor  in my own small life 
your love patient deep  when i turned i saw such joy  your look touch oh my 
the old man  venus  black tarantula 
clumps of ice hitch a ride  on the backs of grass swaying  in the light breeze 
sucked your tounge  don't know why this i regret  maybe pot ya know 
a short collection  of haiku and tanka for  independence day 
the beat of the drum  the shuffle of feet  goodnight from the haiku king 
my pockets empty  i spent so much to have you  come be poor with me 
the lonely flower  on the steep peak stands alone  among wallflowers 
take it easy man   dig your way out the ocean   just lay back and float 
the sun hails morning   shy amid the muted sky   quiet lavender 
empty hospitals  common in utopia  bad news for blue cross 
blood on the concrete  mainlanders come after me  for freedom we fight 
november has come  i'm another year older  november has gone 
a misspoken word  and now the day seems ruined  i'm getting nowhere 
i love my black cat  she snuggles up in my bed  and makes it her home 
those three little words  they have the power to kill  i can not say them 
after brief silence  the birds chirp outside again  time to sleep i guess 
a chorus of frogs  are peeping their spring notes in  a soprano bog 
a heart will grow past  the shadows of present rain  but still the rain falls 
in the night alone  i see the full moon so bright  it will be alright 
i don't mean to brag  watched a pot until it boiled  well i almost did 
marooned on an island  so far from home  but never so close 
restless summer night  you wrap your arms around me  and i am at peace 
effacing her name  at a pigment parlor to  freedom usa 
bright flash of lightning  heard from afar as thunder  the storm incarnate 
sown by the seagulls  dipping in the cloudy rows  and tilling their field 
insects awakening  after days of brutal heat  finally it's cool 
be patient with me  i've got it all together  but you keep adding 
truth ideation  the essence of creation  shifting throughout time 
the rooster sits still  under the morning moonlight  waiting for the sun 
controller in hand  gaming console whirs to life  worlds await within 
a fire in the snow  flamed against the feeder for  his sunflower seeds 
shutting the window  i see one brown leaf dangling  from a maple branch 
planetary chess  intergalactic tactics  anxiety stress 
sense of déjà vu  as if this happened before  and might happen again 
calm down babe relax  i know the water is cold  i'll watch as you sink 
saved by our nature  mankind will resolve all wrong  in nuclear war 
exploring daydreams  wings of possibilities  soar like peregrines 
anger within you  it colors your words and deeds  love will set you free 
i wait for the bus  the clouds are looking gloomy  it finally rains 
men yell for freedom  one took one shot to the chest  suddenly silence 
my love of haiku  this reddit thread breaks apart  i look no longer 
foggy morning sky  and chilly temperatures  fall is in the air 
needle to the groove  the earth is spinning around  flip to the bside 
resplendent new day  foreboding persisting still   living in the past 
is the grass greener  looks just perfect over there  am i stood in dust 
random thoughts of you  chance to see you that same day  only saké now 
truth revealedoh my  misunderstood for so long  now to contemplate 
panting on a twig  the battered bug body and  crimped antenna won 
trying to be cool  hoping karma increases  down voted again 
i can't overcome  the curse of the blank canvass  trapped by four white walls 
noodles twirl and rise  bubbling tomatoes and meat  make my mouth water 
once i loved the sun  for me it fell from the sky  now night never ends 
a grass on a road   swaying gently in the breeze   tranquil and peaceful 
unwavering love   this is what i feel for you   till my dying breath 
rainy days are nice  it's like the sky is crying  i feel less alone 
mirror in the wall   i pass by no reflection  all the lights go off 
sometimes i wonder   if my shouts of anger are   music for the birds 
more more more more more  we need to keep consuming  termites eating wood 
hey listen here man  i know that guac is extra  gotta treat yo'self 
grandmother showed us  slowworms in the allotment  bathing in the dirt 
rolling hills of clouds   perception fades and wanders   of what will i dream 
stones carelessly thrown  in the calmest of waters  propogate ripples 
you rinse with water   don't spray into the darkness   clean posterior 
i dreamt we all sat  beneath our persimmon tree  my elysium 
if i kill myself   to kill what i have become  who wins in the end 
into the darkess  silhouette of depression  lying next to me 
from the horizon  every inch of sacred ground  shattered by shadows 
the dew fell at dawn  little beads brought from the sky  to nourish the earth 
in my room i think  pails of tears spill unbelieved  lost highway risen 
coffee i drink black   wake and bake toke at the lake   heart hollow and cold 
the damage is done  i'm running to get away  too littletoo late 
a churning body  regurgitated our filth  hurling it ashore 
right upon your birth  you were briefly the youngest   person in the world 
crisp air cuts the night  illumined by a fall moon  ivory tombstones glow 
sitting on the pier  as the world flows around you  watching the sun set 
one chance to explain  and the monster you run from  will swiftly be slain 
they claim they love me  they love who i used to be  sometimes people change 
the knees are creaky  like an old ocotillo  in the desert wind 
the evergreen  bundled up in silk and stars  kindles dormant hearts 
i am history  just a ghost of my former self   i wait here alone 
life isn't perfect  no matter how much you stir  there are always lumps 
my dark passenger  the monster beneath the man  rises after dusk 
young birds in a tree  crying for their mother's care  silence fills the air 
once vibrant corals  bleached white without company  o woe onto us 
snoring in my ear  peacefully my husband sleeps  why oh why can't i 
crisp stillness at night  on the crust of winter's end  cold snap in the air 
murder scene jigsaw  put the pieces together  find out who done it 
the moon is lit red  its a strange sense of calmness  trees sing with a breeze 
heavy rains deafen  all cries  tread with umbrella 
they could have capsized   but luck was in their favour   and they were on land 
joy and thanksgiving  love received given to all  a glimpse of heaven 
i held your hand i  will let go eventually  for now just hold mine 
on a mountaintop   i slice open my stomach   sipping an egg yolk 
casting magic spells  a novel kindling rebirth  why are you smiling 
the soft whisper jet  what do you call it when it drops  she is a killer 
milking dairy juice  fettered but yet still free aww  simple joys in life

here i am falling  into the failure that is  my dull existence 
in tents or intense  our intent is everything  for love me or not 
boomers successful  children get educated  no home student debt 
winter is coming  snowflakes start to fall from the sky  they land on white snow 
after thirty years  my hands numbed and scarred over  have seen better days 
winter crescent moon  chalice tipped by the goddess  down comes crystal dew 
coronavirus   birds sing in squares undisturbed   i am the one caged 
in brazil we don't  mind the metric in haikus  as long as they're fun 
unknown and disguised  what purpose does he stay here  alone for a friend 
to drown my sorrows  oh what a weird concept  when it's me drowning 
the love i thought of  the agony and despair  hope is never lost 
my heart beats faster  while getting dressed to go out  thinking about you 
to be best of tao   give your self a way muon   more bubbles to pop 
sure could use a patch  that would mend me and make you  undesirable 
birds of paradise   violently shake in the storm   just like my heartstrings 
the river it turns  fast and slow changes many  the river of life 
lazy little bees  venture out territories  wilderness ahead 
fear joy love pain you   perfect distant beyond reach   warm peaceful asleep 
some six feet under  i lay in eternal rest  death is such a bore 
you're different to me  hundred questions filled with wonder  million questions filled with hate 
the world is over  there is nothing left out there  i must go on now 
let's do drugs and die   this life is not worth living   let's end it slowly 
waking up alone  cigarettes smoked in silence  a mourning dove coos 
i have twin cacti   their names are both steve and george   thanks for being there 
chewed lips part unsure  feelings begging to escape  no sound to be heard 
you deserve to smile  what i don't know about you  it never mattered 
this is a haiku  sometimes they do not make sense  illuminati 
use a strong rubber  if you are in big trouble  whilst drawing a duck 
patting a tiger  it will roar loudly at you  eat dinner instead 
silence broke itself  under the weight of your words  the echoes still ring 
there's rustling outside   chirps signal that all is well  raccoons cross the lawn 
in the skies above  hiding blue skies behind  clouds never ending 
rhyme there is no rhyme   haiku and only haiku   prosed the small green sage 
thick cries through thin walls  the longest day of the year  the window is closed 
you careless young fool  we can't undo this damage  was it worthwhile 
gravestones in the fog  river swells softly nearby  when will it arrive 
wake me in the night  so i may hear thine sweet voice  the song i long for 
we cling to summer  letting autumn go to waste  memento mori 
my body vibrates  when i look into your eyes  pull me close to you 
i love you hate you   i know that you are leaving   please stay a while 
i spent yesterday   sipping coffee and writing  terrible haiku 
the distant spring moon  lights the eyes of a field mouse  and spreads an owls wings 
my cat is angry   we arn't under blankets yet  going to bed now 
sent you a message  unfortunate no reply  tinder game is weak 
to wander the earth  searching for what we all seek  what is our purpose 
when washing dishes  only be washing dishes  this is mindfulness 
no muff is too tough  want your pussy in my face  dance in the bed sheets 
i find peace in noise  looking at the sun still see  i die from the moon 
she's gone already   it's only been four minutes   and i'm missing her 
wake up every day  spent all alone with my thoughts  i wish you were there 
my penis is small  i always piss on my balls  diaper is a must 
summer night cold sweat  nuzzle deeper in my neck  soft fitful dreamer 
dragons soaring high  over under chacked  imagine wagons 
thick hot southern air  carrying a strange scent of  black eucalyptus 
something like a dream   you here listening right now   my breath calls your name 
i will wear short sleeves  on purpose so our arms touch  while we are dancing 
seems a tad surreal  three thousand apparently  too good to be true 
i lack direction  not nearly as determined  as my cement shoes 
where water flows dark  and crows drop dead from the sky  i found a heart cold like mine 
obsidian heart  i endure fractures follow  hollow light seeps in 
ah bonjour tristesse   i am emotionally  unavailable 
headache cough sneezing  the human predicament  trapped in my body 
australia burns  smoke from bush fires turns sky red  wait and hope for rain 
i just smoked a bowl  my anxiety is gone  blissfully relaxed 
hands shoot up and up   faster than a gun duel  which student to choose 
i fantasize much   about stupid little things   like smacking my friends 
three birds again   the black coven   but others chirp 
chubby cats on rafts  they float downstream back to back  felines relax 
we said forever   though we knew it was a lie   my heart is broken 
glaring at me and  stating no comment is a  blank sheet of paper 
limitless as sky  without beginning or end  the mind of buddha 
turbulent life  she lived but will she one day  live as my wife 
good morning momma  here's to your own special day  you cooking breakfast 
venus mother of women  locked in eternal sun gaze  clouds raining acid 
born here you belong  the earth gives us land for free  so we can live free 
love is an echo  of our desire to be loved  whispered to the dark 
pride misleads diverts  broken when i fail and fall  lord i surrender 
entry level role  min five years experience  contract to hire 
with a wagging tail  you parade across the yard  treasured bone in mouth 
moon glistening on   the forests tress   the coyotes howl 
true trepidation  fear like a tsunami sweeps  what if this goes well 
in this shameful world  a fine lad and a burger  running on empty 
message to my child  take your time and please have fun  message to myself 
hate anger envy  ugly human emotions  not to we will try 
smiling in the sun  my dog does not stress about  the meaning of life 
gather round the sun  so our sins can be undone  our souls now scorched clean 
orange fuji slopes  the disgraced samurai kneels  sword agleam with blood 
everything good fades  i'm anchored in this bad place  i need to get out 
spinnakers blended  to watercolor in their  competitive heat 
lovefriendshiphighly valued concepts  once those concepts are put to test  they're nothing but thatconcepts 
the blue light special  making reservations to  be seated in court 
i reach out to you  with calloused hands come with me  and escape this world 
fly mutant bird fly  spread your wings into the sky  you look like two birds 
drowned in tears spring pours  every drop falls rumbling  waiting for sunshine 
thanks to a new house  political game of chess  trump is now in check 
gone is carelessness  the days of worry now here  what now why the fuck 
traps await guide me  your light breaking through the fog  love leading each step 
men that work the earth  to a different thing submit  to its human shell 
so sweet as ever   i wrote you this short letter   love you forever 
unyielding fury  justifiable vengeance  unseen enemy 
separate no longer  atoms reach a consensus  we must unionize 
no gods no masters  no one to tell us we're wrong  together we can 
gagged bound and exposed   paint the caves of the ancients   fifty shades of cream 
unconditional  withholding what keeps me strong  can't it be like before 
is this even a haiku  or only a poem in my  imagination 
how man mistakes fate  for lack of choise or free will  a wise man thinks twice 
overwhelming task  where is it that i should start  can't i just give up 
the purple flowers  icy breaths of winter wind  stir the withered leaves 
i liked her a lot  walked her home after party  last time i saw her 
stay my golden sun  warmth joy drive vision life itself  go the world needs you 
midnight flowers bloom  upon the thundering sky  a new year is born 
in their sunday best  they go to church down the street  from where they will rest 
there is social cold  in the city without lights  beer is firewood 
the air feels crispy  there is a clean and cold breeze  the trees slowly sway 
so i know this girl  daughter of my very best  lover to nothing 
warm compliments   bite back through the frosted air   heat heals an iced mind 
whimpering child  always new reasons for tears  my damaged ego 
walking on the moon  earth rising in full glory  the home of mankind 
the night sky will sing  stars will dance to celebrate  the return of love 
calm before the wind  emotions storm within  dry eyes without tears 
aphids referee  while beetle and mantis lock  on a rosebud mat 
fever dreams collide  hallucinatory skies  sickness is not kind 
i stood up for me  i feel no guilt about it  for once in my life 
let the rain fall slow  wash free the day's ambition  free your busy mind 
the quiet room stands still  from the window i seek strength  but it lies within 
lost in space and time  i focus on the flower  brought back down to earth 
spring leaves emerging  gone by seasons forgotten  brighter days begin 
friday night again  time to turn to haikus for  my weekend sadness 
poetry is art  quarantine is a science  my dog is my friend 
my heart a lightning   rod and your laughter a strike   oh i am smitten 
a rhyme in loud space  is just the same as colors  on a busy page 
the amazon truck   approaches slowly for me  it rumbles past damn 
let your heart roam free  or you'll take it to the grave  and it dies with you 
a journey began  now the end is in my sight  led by love and grace 
been feeling alone  well here we are together  need you here with me 
your words drip like ink  staining us permanently   faded blurred and smudged 
i've found the reason  a warm crippling sensation  why cant i keep you 
tiny spark ignites  flame grows burns swells with no release  misery within 
caterpillars are   walking on the moon to see   me in the shower 
groggy mists submerge  a break for the open air  and light's path repaved 
dry eyes close with tears  summer showers show the way  grief bends the breaking 
just a pale blue dot  the vicissitudes within  pray towards what end 
silence takes music  from noise as does death take life  from our existence 
the moon is in view  illuminating the night  i can't fall asleep 
light beams through the hall  dog pants hoping to answer  the call of nature 
you can't run away  someday it will destroy you  the weight of your sins 
light has frequencies  what determines its color  not so black and white 
i hope the world ends  the very moment he leaves  so you die alone 
such foul disbelief  the misery never relieves  lamb seeks for penance 
port control peepers  terminal nudity and  no fig leaf for shame 
maddie is our cat   meow purr sleep eat poo and puke   just mostly cat things 
my disappointment  is immeasurable and  my day is ruined 
i get low to write  dark thoughts churn into haikus  have to get up soon 
i get an upvote  on every post  before it is viewed 
twilight admission  for the acappella in  a cricket concert 
feeling helpless now   tiny fragile seeds of fall   summer brings sweet fruit 
i just have to know   were you ever truly mine  i don't think you were 
consistent pursuit  relentless attempts to win  fruition is near 
spring nightly wake up  rattle of a stretched farting  cuts silence of dark 
thrills amount to naught  spiralling repetition  it's time to wake up 
perfect are your words  constantly given to me  i hear and believe 
black and white restless  thoughts storm mental horizon  truth's deluge drowns heart 
lost my soprano   younger woman look at me   closer to the grave 
old wizard ponders  magic cipher interupt  spells cast long shadows 
the sun hidden there  awaiting the next chapter  time to shine my friend 
words are mere shovels  dig in the rubble for graves  or for survivors 
fearful men sprout wings  but hero and coward fly  different directions 
would you like me to  remove your food from your fridge   or let it untouched 
don't do it for them  do it for the kid at heart  the one that won't die 
the silly blue hat  blend with your ocean eyes  they seep into me 
deep down in the heart  of the sea of pink and white  a bright blue egg cracks 
oh sorrowful day  my efforts lie in shambles  deafening silence 
sorry about that  your mascara still looks good  running down your cheeks 
detachment is like  a knot tied so hard it breaks  two pieces hurting 
i choose selfishness  one last night with my family  goodbyes are so hard 
puppet strings cut  yet i'm still being controlled  a slave to my past 
trees dance in moonlight  cold wind chilling to their roots  they can't sleep either 
that snowy silence  the still cold air feels breathless  a calm peaceful chill 
my grief cripples me  making it hard to live breathe  wish you were still here 
sitting on toilet  rubber band for my wallet  i am becoming old man 
mountains dress in snow  waking walks over canvas  red orange yellow 
morning suns soothes me  congested interstate pains  horizons expand 
teardrops of bright light  so beautiful so lifeless  never so alone 
will you stay the night  his eyes dropped as his heart sunk  not tonight my love 
if not for the wind  i would hear my heartbeat  echo in the night 
today i went out  out in my car to the bank  breathing easier 
i tried on my mask  my mother sewed it herself  once curtain fabric 
you won't change others  if you engage in debate  with only yourself 
reach a higher plane  nobody understands how  what is consciousness 
our eyes once had met  possibility of love  a missed connection 
the weight lifter bridge  is raising his trestle while  boats puff underneath 
so close yet so far  are you my husband or friend  i wish you'd touch me 
footprints in cold sand  foam crested waves  wash away our memories 
your little hurdles  are so easily traversed  how high i would jump 
alone on friday  wasting my time on reddit  i am so lonely 
if heaven exists  i hope i have done enough  to thank my mother 
an eagle flies free  its waiting for the thunder  ride the sky old friend 
sitting outside in  dialectical weather  cold wind and hot sun 
pandemic crisis  what will be our salvation  open book exams 
weeping willow trees  caressing the dark water  silence fills the air 
fall is bittersweet  i wish summer would repeat  seasonal defeat 
her hands on the wheel  he the passenger watches  her bare thighs at work 
breakfast cereal  a simple carb splashed with milk  great morning sustenance 
one point to one point  measured precisely over time  far away or close 
with uncertainty  each wave approaches the shore  then crashes with pride 
shut up and do it  linus you corporateshill  give me your techtip 
toxic memories  binding chains shroud happiness  must break through somehow 
you smell terrible  beautiful colors of hair  array of fungus 
our joy today  we walk hand in hand  in hope alleluia 
fiery leaves  littering the damp ground  mourning the summer 
in my dream she says  where have you been all my life  been waiting for you 
guitarists sound great  my favourite is  his music is good 
clouds thin out  the moon appears  soon sunrise 
you called we chatted  lives intersected today  tomorrow perhaps 
you said no flowers  so here is a bonsai tree  it still has flowers 
one mans broken speech  echoes cut through valleys deep  the wind is alive 
is it cathartic  to unleash it all sometimes  i ask the storm cloud 
the fields are green  summer is showing itself  yet the days are cold

screeching crescendo  born from the void of stillness  gone without a trace 
why are you selfish  our mother has sacrificed  we owe her the world 
service my intent  oh how your joy fueled my hope  loves intersected 
the accusations  a black cloud i cannot shake  dance me to the death 
shoulders were your throne   now you raise a son your own   while carrying me 
go get what you want  flowers don't waste their colors  trying to decide 
why must my hair grow  only in the places that  i do not want it 
artifacts you seek  hidden in ancestral lands  callused hands dig deep 
a man who gambles  seldom brings himself to see  all debts forgiven 
a boy and balloon  rolling happily while they're  both tied to a chair 
not knowing life   curse of guilt   ignorance is bliss 
power with patience  i seek stillness mindfully  my breath creates space 
oh how fast they fly   soaring right before our eyes   twelve months of my year 
all the pretty girls  flaunt their glitter wedding rings  magpies squawk at beads 
privacy betrayed  senators demand answers  he pretends to care 
i dislike covid  in partnership we are not  it should be novid 
all of the promise  the hope of new beginnings  slipped through my fingers

'no one likes complex'  said mother while building my  said complexes 
far out on a limb  for an apple of the eye  recalling past falls 
the clock strikes seven  time to start the grind once more  what retirement 
the fire crews were called  after smoke was seen in sky  turned out to be cloud 
the bright moon looks down  sparkling ice reflecting back  a million dreams 
winters cold has passed  nature gives back what she took  death resurrected 
surreptitiously  the conspiring grey cat turns  afar its frail prey 
brave ant emerges   morning dew drops onto head   danger back inside 
then i said 'goodbye'  and i stepped out into the rain  a finite treasure 
the ink still sings   on my fingers   cherry blossom rain 
come sit by the fire  traveler set down your pack  leave the road outside 
beautiful dentist  french accent as sweet as pie  heavenly torture 
i would not change me  if i had a time machine  it would collect dust 
thought you knew  now you do and you will change  hold my hand 
boogie woogie dance  that banjo and kazooie  coming back to smash 
i kept the flowers   inside my books while your words   bloom inside my heart 
i sit here hoping  hitting refresh without pause  waiting to see blue 
we are sandcastles  eroding away with time  destined for the sea 
i woke up early   but there were no more pop tarts   i hate you so much 
a glimpse through the trees  shattering my heart like glass  moonlight memory 
i needed her hug  to feel her warmth and heartbeat  no love like her love

the circle of life   looking for a midday snack   hawks circle on high 
nobody's perfect  except jesus and they beat  the crap out of him 
words left unspoken  feelings that we used to share  fading memories 
worldly distractions  draw my gaze waste my stepssigh  backtrack and resume 
curly haired youngster   impish smile that hides your pain  why did you do it 
my heart speaks to you  do you listen i hold back  i wait for you 
what is a notebook  but a ream of wispy thoughts  yet to be transcribed 
read the same story  in the local newspaper  twice so far this week 
deep within one's heart  lies the strongest of desires  must fulfill wishes 
back from the war  all his doors  swollen shut 
fear of commitment  always searching for better  ending up alone 
gnawing on my toes  a hungry little shadow  whose teeth can't break skin 
as i hear them cry  i wish to hold and soothe them  this coffin stops me 
edit practice on the side  developing newfound skills  more skills under belt 
the sky is so clear  baby blue clean air white clouds  the earth is cleansing 
brilliant clear blue days  daffodil and dogwood bloom  when i was a child 
your smile for me thanks  eyes metwords of love exchanged  friends on a journey

cursing powerpoint  sunday perfect spring weather  it's due tomorrow 
sodium vapor  cigarette burning amber  under amber glow 
feelings are mounting  explosion of lead to red   thinking am i dead 
new bedtime routine  meditation before sleep  such compelling dreams 
ev'ry time i get her  there it feels like i stole one  from you come scoring 
in my ears too soon  a sparrow weeps will stay strong  heaven and hell flinches 
flashing lights sirens  fireflies and coyotes  flood deserted streets 
haiku i like you  careful with my words i am  you're perfect for me 
a cautious bluejay  lands on crispy winter leaves  and a few crackers 
last two tomatoes  hanging under winter frost  their red hue is gone 
picking up my pen  a new story in my head  time to try again 
death of butterflies  sweet release from anxiety  no cure for lost love 
how did i forget  to pray each day for you friend  today i begin 
i have to learn how  to get up from a table  where love is not served 
swooping in before  blurting ugly words had the  spirit tying tongues 
sometimes i think that   there is no god or at least   the one i pray to 
baby crying now  hungry and tired she must be  sleep i will not get 
help freely given  blessed to receive such good gifts  angels beside me 
running down hill  so fierce yet so calming  tiny river 
i learn to love things  some people say it's fake love  i learned to love it 
best friend sent me back  turns out i'm best friend's father  the timeline's confused 
spaghetti westerns  the classic cowboy movies  a guilty pleasure 
handwriting practice  pencil itches the paper  until satisfied

belief is like an  oyster a piece of shit gets  in and forms a pearl 
rooted is our love  foundations beneath the earth  bloom like a flower 
by the river bank  the light of the dawn heralds  the cricket's last song 
her hands running through   his paintbrush hair colored me   every shade of green 
the fog drifts around  swelling and leaking all day  june is drunk again 
standing on thin ice  fearing the brake beneath me  holding my deep breath 
too late for flowers  water inundates the land  the streams' last hurrah 
i love the version  of the world that's in my head  so i stay in bed 
still cool on dark lake  the flash of a kingfisher  the moment is gone 
wind chimes and birdsong   music to the lei weaver   in the pink orchard 
sea breeze is calming   it brings back the memories   that are beautiful 
the stars have aligned  the great heroes have returned  they are twilight force 
carefully raised heads  peaking above the white shroud  so many flowers 
sing your song for us  sing of summers sing of peace  silence never more 
a crumb of food falls  ants swarm on the site quickly  always on the watch 
you are my luna  i am the wolf still howling  the thistle wilted 
so many haiku  seemingly no two the same  each like a snowflake 
oh anxiety  if i fall in love with you  will you go away 
plant an idea  stirred nest of bees ready to  wage a holy war 
language darkened truth  thankful for guidance sought found  filed in memory 
the owl soars silent  it takes a hold of its prey  victory is sweet 
i'm scared of people   i hide from them in my room   why am i scared though 
rolling up to flames  and stretching out a neck it  was spouting for life 
my mirror image  two heart beats bound to one soul  maybe next lifetime 
in my warm flannels  hot cocoa and some netflix  just me and my cat 
gluttonous gossips  office workers daily fare  spread on wagging tongues 
i do not like you  i sew the seeds of self doubt  i hope you withdraw 
i have determined  to live in the arena  so i will die there 
good morning i   must inform you i'm   a sex offender 
a prism was casting  his covenant on the wall  with a square rainbow 
audience of one  who dares to match your glory  let your kingdom come 
what is this i feel  that is not so dull  nor so melancholy 
bayonet beaks are  protecting progeny in  wing to wing combat 
three weeks or a year  finite time matters little  chase eternity 
a hoodied figure  some people like to judge me  yet i write poems 
the bass and six string  the real ones that got away  a few minutes late 
staccato  raindrops on awnings  croaking frogs 
feeling all alone  leave me sitting in corners  yet stones are skipping 
the stress is too strong  will to overcome is weak  i can't live like this 
enforced confinement  stay within the boundaries   my life and haikus 
winter sun shines bright  eyelids close wanting darkness  morning comes too soon 
suddenly awake  the metronome clock ticking  dream or memory 
a third of today  feels like all my yesterdays  alone with my heart 
jojo fights dio  dio immortal vampire  jojo has hamon 
unfolding the flakes  and clinging to windows with  his blunt creation 
losing my marbles   is she a chair or toothbrush   need moar videos 
published my third book   haikus in the florida keys   buy it on amazon 
opened door  the night went cold  my toes feel old your scent lingers with me 
my plans your planschoose  i choose to follow you lord  always the best choice 
darkness approaches  something wicked this way comes  run away and hide 
love flows through my heart  memory of you my veins  our lives now entwined 
mascara painted sky  crying for the lost and found  we wear masks don't we all 
once perfect petals   beautiful dandelion   scatters in the wind 
ripple in the calm  streaming motes of life pass by  the river of life 
haiku on the web   will travel great distances   i share this with you 
working out my brain  sudoku word games tetris  i will not give up 
i miss holding you  i miss rocking you to sleep  safe warm in my arms 
falling through darkness  rescue never came for me  i'm cold and alone 
secrets rattle doors  scratch at walls whisper small words   too dark for hearing 
ur mom ur mom ur  mom ur mom ur mom ur mom  ur mom ur mom ur 
the soul has left us  find it in a moonlit sun  an empty bright void 
all of this paper  and nothing to write about  damn you writer's block 
when in doubt haiku  when not in doubt still haiku  never don't haiku 
southeast and northwest   never shall they meet they said   we defied the rules 
walking in the fog  steps ahead the dog dissolves  the red leash remains 
when she doesnt call  everything sounds like your phone  ringing in your head 
good morning my love  i can't believe you're not here  good mourning indeed 
giant teddy bear  what do i do with you now  no place to put you 
there love in your eyes  there joy in time ideas shared  there prayers answered 
seven hundred legs  scuttling through my kitchen  the house centipede 
two worlds call me theirs  each at war spitting hate sad  loved yet still lonely 
a smile shows joy   forgotten troubles of life   a smile masks pain 
rest easy my friend  memories fade like spring but  you i will carry 
sand banks  all the city  that was jettisoned 
heretodayreally  in plain sight but i missed it  unveiled by our love 
you pour them some tea  but they decide if it's half  full or half empty 
this inspiration  one day from me will cease  yield not strive forward 
dice a game of chance   love a risky game to play   i can't break even 
fierce orange sunset  see your face in the skyline  i loathed that spray tan 
on election eve  no friendship seems strong enough  to bridge the divide 
darting through the woods  babies learning with their mom  footprints in the snow 
omnipotence nailed  departing work early for  the friday called good 
the end of the day  in the tall grass of the field  the outline of deer 
marching to fight guns  bravery and courage but  you should be running 
green leaves overhead  bird song above idle chat  cigarettes in sun 
i like dogs and cats  and videos of life hacks  would put up with you 
i watch my son grow  there beyond the years of time  he watches his own 
cold again today  pale grey clouds no end in sight  spring seems far away 
everyone in black   searching for the true colors   they should look inside 
gleaming edge stands tall  last defense against them all  brilliance blinds their gall 
wish i could give you  the peace that you desperately need  termoil inside 
striving is futile  dim alienation  content with solace 
their engines cut back  and were guided tenderly  tugging into port 
inviting warm lips  soft supple skin glistening  in the faint moonlight 
i fell down the stairs  it seems i fell for you too  both hurt just as bad 
yes i still love you  i must be weak or just a fool  it has been a year 
the power of skin  battleground of the wealthy  what color am i 
a kneel condemned  voices ignored and then  a kneel killed 
arm in arm as one  old elm branches interlaced  days shorten leaves fall 
hepatica blooms  splash of pink among dead leaves  hope ephemeral 
i'm dripping with sweat  a big log falls from my crack  soon i smell the stank 
they made us into  lampshades and saved our hair and   teeth but not our kids 
critical eye leers  only perfection will do  never once resting 
leaves fluttering by  the colors mixing in air  fall is upon us 
death will soon take you  and all the ones you love  inevitably 
potential for good   capacity for evil   man mediates both 
told my bread has mould  bought gaskets paper glasses  weirdly not hectic 
a product announced  but never manufactured  merely vaporware 
spiders eat the bugs   and stray cats eat the spiders   let em have my yard 
countryside in spring  colors of new growth and life  grace receivedrevealed 
dozing fat black cat  warms his belly in the sun  i sigh with envy 
does life have a point  thoughts of a twisted headspace  man i want some food 
smoke curls in the flue  gold lights flicker on the hearth  as the window yawns 
god is dyslexic  we need pzazz in our lives  but we get pizza 
all my female friends  beautiful inside and out  in love with them all 
i ate a hotdog   but it was really a pig   nobody cares though 
daylight won't deter  creepy cars on roadways with  a headless driver 
love mercy forgiveness  thanksgiving ever will i give  to you lord 
lone surfer bobbing  up and down and up and down  rolling with the waves 
counting my blessings  sorrow misery despair  ungrateful graces 
persistent warning  many months to deter this  a meltdown occurs 
death comes for us all  our ghosts will remain to haunt  those who still recall 
disease by degrees  you bravely face loss of self  your haiku cut 
dry eyes in the night   inspiration locked away   my dreams are waiting 
a dream about you  evokes emotion no more  means nothing to me 
busy saturday  dishes laundry cookingchores  anyone can help 
aurora in sky  colorful lights are dancing  majestic event 
you just stopped caring  and just like that we went from  soulmates to strangers 
joy of family  cherishing friends then and now  lord you have blessed us 
so fat and fluffy  love me a cat on my lap  great for a small nap 
tested this day  may your will be done  your lovethanks 
no children at school   the streets are empty of life  walk my dog alone 
clouds knocking about  with pillowcase play sending  little tufts adrift 
today i just can't   ideas don't come to me   i create nothing 
a winter morning  a hot cup of black tea  warms my frozen soul 
twilight admission  for the acappella at  a cricket concert 
my cat once told me  life is immediacy  and then reflection 
tears from loneliness  make a lovely substitute  for tears from abuse 
eyes in a portrait  that follow you while in sight  seem to know your mind 
the wind through our hair  and canvassed as criminal  had given us knots 
don't depend on me  i am not reliable  can't fulfill your needs 
never sleep around  always sleep in your own bed  camping is not fun 
beijing lies restless  stretching twists of brick rambles  to the blood brown moon 
rebuilding again  rock bottom as foundation  brick by brick new hope 
journeying forward  a single step at a time  in time the results 
the narrative fades  words are long since forgotten  yet the pain remains 
recompense is food  each winter coming faster  storehouse depleted 
animaniacs   dot is cute and yakko yaks  i miss childhood 
tested todayfailed  loved even when i fell hard  your presencemy joy 
by heredity  ethnicity and assets  traffic all our lives 
the mind of buddha  without beginning or end  became like the sky 
for your protection  the identity police  are already here 
the world is quiet   mountains are heavy with mist   the mourning dove sings 
terra australis  in the depths of winters chill  my heaters broken 
my mare keeps me up   she trots across tired eyes   my gentle night mare 
cheesy is your love   like a curddled brick of gold   softening with heat 
there lay a red stone   in the heart of a dark cave   was it indeed red 
heart darkened i go  your new headset drowns me out  you don't talk to me 
sitting here alone  in a hotel made for two  what are you thinking 
samurai sword fight   cling clang cling clang cling clang swhack   heads roll through the field 
disbelieving friends  held an april snowball from  his december gloves 
beans on toast  dirty haiku breakfast  a nutritious start 
the rotten apple   falls from the branches   summer is over 
cold evenings chilly  hot heat truly a blessing  appreciate warmth 
what a perfect time  filled for me with love and joy  lord i trust in you 
a toilet flushing  a galaxy is spinning  void is filled anew 
two petty idiots  call each other idiots  as they walk off cliffs 
who could have known that  the muse he was looking for  was him all along 
she says she loves me  but shes always so busy  maybe i love her 
the harvest moon shines  let's go plant some potatoes   and find me a wife 
hats off to the guy  that invented the toilet  this flush is for you 
are you good at it  can you repeat those results  that's efficacy 
rolling over once  more i hit the snooze button  five more minutes please 
beauty came to me  and climbed to my lap only  asking to be seen 
in this blooming word   boundless love is free to all   here we share this peace 
feeling good writing  while the world was burning  i can't be sorry 
cold wind is so fierce  the sake runs strong and warm  good time to relax 
dead fish look   grocery store closing   rain falls abruptly 
your eyes hypnotize   i think to much here she comes   eye contact and smiles 
there's a road i know  that goes gas brake turn repeat  tail of the dragon 
it's storming outside  but it's within that i freeze  no wood to burn here 
like an ox she wills  her way under immense load  fighting tooth and nail 
all day long i grind  indebted to a raccoon  give me golden tools 
a surprise call  bridges burn faster over  running water 
voices from outdoors  clamouring for attention  drown whispers within 
creativity   oversimplification  opportunity 
rocks thrown down a well  splash but no one knows except me  my little secret forever 
it's when the gods fall   men went up as replacements   time for men to fall 
sitting in hell's heat   refusing to turn the ac on   whistler's cheap ass mom 
serenading spring  green verse and rhythmic whistles  cadence to outdoors 
i hold leaves and grass  soft dewy and freshly cut  does it feel like life 
anonymous name  alternate identity   perhaps the real me 
honey no i don't  this is only for tonight  gone before morning 
babies cannot swim   but we still put them in pools   for magazine ads 
thinking on the past   do not dwell on your mistakes   there is only now 
a smirk in the dark  cheap dress peeled off in silence  petals fall apart 
breaking my promise  i steal one last look and smile  i won't say goodbye 
life right now  a sour glass of milk  and no cookies 
i struggle with the  fact that i require to  be alone and not 
behind ivy doors  a mantis blushing green had  pivoted her face 
murky blue waters  the mermaids sing out their songs   lure men to their death 
silent reflections  spring's chill in the ancient church  please fix the heating 
racism exists  because we ignore the fact  we are the same race 
mum was so caring  nothing will be fine again  why aren't my clothes clean 
here i sit alone  gazing off into the sky  clouds of smoke rising 
choking and coughing  signs that you are still breathing  cleaning out the phlegm 
a shamanic dance  uncertainty is certain  what absurdity 
radishes in september  dream longings of next april  soft soothing spring rains 
i said i had warts  she said it's okay it's like  roughrider condoms 
time passes with thoughts  perhaps it'll take a lifetime  to understand life 
an old rusty sink  gentle touch on faucet tip  droplets running free 
it is them or they   vague but not without purpose   peace their medium 
you are my fortress  without you i am homeless  surrounded by storms 
dancing mad fractal  defined comfort illusions  simple protocol 
dark clouds in my mind  seeking shelter from the storm  that shall never break 
chilly autumn air  toasty warm bed and trackies  discarding for work 
did you hear that one died  who was so cool and sexy  now on to the next 
the eyes will not lie   the only part of ourselves   we cannot disguise 
i scream with such glee   for i can see in this void   if only six feet 
i look up at night  he is the bright northern star  calling my heart home 
you may be a cat   but you understand me most   even without a word 
she's ash in the ground  joy sadness pain memories  buried alone now 
sometimes a feeling  never wants to go away  though you may hate it 
white round host on tongue   blessed benzodiazepines   science miracle 
oaks and pines and night  your window shines as i walk  with snow in my beard 
a short love story  we never said i love you  now we never will 
frozen white spider   inside of my drinking jar   moonstone eyes pierce me 
dreams of you fill me  we loved lived through ups and downs  hugs are what i need 
curbside piano  she peers while he stoops looking  both tinkering there 
solid as a rock  stubborn unrequited love  fierce as a wildfire 
a wonderful day   i could do with more of these   a joint and my dog 
dust returns to dust  the revolving door of time  life returns to life 
negative karma  i was not even trolling here  i messed up in life 
unable to sleep  who is haunting me this night  i hope they find peace 
without foundation  your ideas are no more than  a fart in the wind 
surrounding myself  looking for those who like me  i have found myself 
now look what's happened  the worst possible outcome  i apologise 
work project now done  painstakingly laborious  mission accomplished 
a cheek turned bright red   guilt turns the bright soul azure   apologetic 
every letter marked  return back  forgot postage stamp 
day falls to the knight  across confines with his lance  light is now darkness 
to dream is to not  give up to persevere when  you're all out of luck 
it's easy you say  makes me feel stupid cause it's  not easy for me 
so i take shelter  find a new hiding place  underneath the pines 
beautiful poem   captures the moment with love   and makes immortal 
as summer ends  the shades project their shadows  the warmth calms me 
you have conquered all  which others have done to you  don't lose to yourself 
in sickness and health  not as your wife or mistress  i as your soulmate 
i am way too drunk  how does this work anyway  i like beer and stuff 
dark empty kitchen  steal some snacks then back to bed  no one has to know 
lost inspiration  the calm spring wind suffocates  no matter the times 
i tried to haiku  but had no inspiration  breath of fire iii 
the ultimate chance  thirteen seconds to count down  red wire or blue wire 
too many wedgies  suffered through in middle school  hence the attitude 
one slice of brioche   bacon lettuce tomato   brioche slice again 
call her beautiful  sit back let her do her thing  you won't be let down 
you bang on my door  there are no squares in nature  no life in a box 
do not fool yourself  what may seem like a dark sky  is a passing cloud 
big thud imminent  brace for impact idiot  far from a class act 
thanks for love and life  love received always given  life to serve my lord 
now i live alone  prolonged habitual gloom  harsh dryer buzzes 
outside a window  the crimson light of sunrise fell  on murmuring rain 
like lunar waters   the iris of your eyes  dull and soften stars 
lessons to be learned  poetic patterns gained ground  perspective altered 
secret messages  sweet nothings while you slumber  i delete them all 
rain shower  melting snow  matted grass 
strangers to begin  dreams fears and stories traded  friends as leaves fall down 
february moon   silent snow crystals howling   ravenous wolves call 
for some damn reason  whenever it comes to you  my hearts left open 
our want is pushing  avarice avenues for  the wildlife to rot 
being given gold  who do i give silver to  so many questions 
autumn's leaf is still  it does not rush from the tree  the wind will guide it 
when no one believes  in you there will be your mom  still supporting you 
limitless ceiling  sky and stars fly by and stare  at the earth below 
look at her smile   can you tell she is faking  broken deep inside 
true disappointment  it's never what it should be  what a life i live 
as death is looming  the fallen become heroes  lost in history 
duck duck duck duck duck   duck duck duck duck duck duck duck   duck duckduckduck goose 
lessons from the sun   cast your light as wide as earth   always rise again 
i lookedthere you were  ever have we loved such joy  us forevermore 
cups by the window  always fuller than the cups  stored in the cupboard 
two broken people  counting down the days gone by  forever it seems 
to oi no sora   kimi no omoi yoou ni  mou ichi do aitai 
i am curious  yellow blue socialism  politics or porn 
are you a wild  orchid kept hidden from view  no one saw you bloom 
you are not a rose   you are the thorns beside it   constant pricks and pain 
dipping my fingers  plucking ice cubes from water  hand across my brow 
a weekly shower  cologne to hide his foul stank  but he's on day nine 
misery detached   move from point a to point b   a humble learning 
a lingering hug  one so tight the world makes sense  i need one today 
hair exudes amber  slowly encouraging him  to love pain she brings 
baby in warp speed   his fat tummy points ahead   his limbs flail behind 
pray for your healing  confident of god's answer  perfect is his love 
which do you want more  the pain of staying the same  or the pain of growth 
infidelity  nights when you say i love you  all lies and deceit 
downvotes 'o plenty  if your haiku has curse words  those are the best ones 
dream stalker   polaroid prey   spread the word 
tears roll down my face  i will never understand  is there more to life 
i know you're still scared  we have so much to lose  i too am afraid 
unmotivated  unheard unsure unnoticed   not undeserving 
freedom is a whole   cannot be picked and chosen   remove one take all 
poppies are blooming  petals cradled by the stream  silent confession 
hands shaking  her stare hypnotizing me  lips forming a smile 
unachievable  will i ever escape my mind  i tire but never quit 
like the spring blossom   i to occasionally   fall gracefully down 
always listening  keep the focus off of you  and how are you fuck 
drop of grey dissolves  in our sea of yesterdays  another today 
a conversation  we had between the daisies  what do the stars mean 
the blue spruce fiat  invited a little bird  to nest in her bough 
love is hard as hell   love is an anomaly   love is wonderful 
last summer's wind chime  dings its two remaining notes  at cold april rain 
there is hollowness  an empty space the dark void   stormy loneliness 
your love is water  my heart awaits underground  to bloom toward you 
write live eulogies  for the ones you love the most  and tell them your heart 
you made all the sounds  and i painted their colours  i chose the wrong shades 
clouds part revealing  a single ray of sunshine  right into my eye 
she critics herself  harshly and without reason  to me shes perfect 
few more years perhaps  ghost of halls i barely see  then at once revealed 
a new source of light    gives me new environments    to admire you in 
my loneliness is  trying to kill me but i  won't lie down and die 
pandemic wedding  thirty people in a tent  forgetting it all 
the bright sun sets far  further than the stars and skies  even birds can't spy 
slicing of the cake  celebration of life  i love you grandma

when we were still young  before the net ensnared us   days were long and free 
im done telling lies  time to be a better man  pinocchio's nose grew 
i wake in the night  stretch roll over reach out and  hug your cold pillow 
last light of the day  the sky so full of colours  peacefulness inside 
quick call the police  the peasants are revolting  and not just the smell 
sing to me my sweet   dress your infidelity   such beautiful lies 
sex equality  it has to be the same rule  for everyone of us 
we are like snowballs  years passed layered to our core  our cores never melt 
morning light washed field  young viridian dew glows  appaloosa wild

i never meant to  my mind is tormented and was  never meant to love 
rolling a steel ring   on my fingers helps me think   keeping the pattern 
complete confidence  power so overwhelming  take on anything 
you are my whole world  shining star that guides me home  across the vacuum 
lets cross the whole world  in parallel lines like the  shadows that abstain

i prime my mind  and the focus brings gifts   of excellent haikus 
a brush of my face  rays cast by the clear blue sky  cool air fills my lungs 
celestial souls  dancing bodies are entwined  spiraling apart 
distant times to come  cloudy skies and under earth  our end is ensured 
my date stood me up  i should be mad but i'm not  i don't even care 
smoke parts  in the search of  a critique partner 
you pull me back in   now these confused emotions   will be my death march 
from birth she smiles   always playful always there   in the end we die 
two drunks get hammered  they lead each other to doom  can either be blamed 
sisätiloissa  kellot vain tikittävät  iän tuomat läikät 
you offer samples   of foods you haven't tasted   practice what you preach 
arboreal arch  bare branches pay homage to  the frozen sky god 
my lonely shadow  spreads his body on the walls  and the room combusts 
i do not know what  is shaking my soul the most  to miss you miss out 
please don't ban me no  i have done no wrong you know   nigger nigger nig 
as i lay awake  fingers taping syllables  a haiku is born 
sun rise time to delve  tip toe through bustling streets  liberty renewed 
over under grip  a gasp for air  fatality 
pentasyllabic  is coincidentally  pentasyllabic 
my balls are bulging  swollen up with sticky cum  size of a balloon 
one day i saw it  the ghost of me standing there  my reflection 
five neighbors gather  tightly in a fleshy ball  a swing and a punch 
temptation within  a rising tiger ready  rise to occasion 
writing every day  my odes have lost their meaning  yet i write again 
the city bankers  watch as the tattered beggar  points at them and laughs 
you don't need to speak  i know how to read by now  twinkles in blue eyes 
why is there no spark   when i have all the matches   they must be burnt out 
schwarma for dinner  chips chicken and a fanta  i hate my dull job 
in this marathon  there were no shoes only sheets  rest is needed now 
people want to talk  issues topics  are you foe  family or friend 
dungeons and dragons   reality fades away   my friends and i play 
bleed encouragement  satan in the waiting room  weep in the stretcher 
so many options  an easy way out for sure  just hard to fit through 
just outside of town  on a dark and lonely road  lost and found of life 
i am the reaper  without me the world would rot  still they want me gone 
fields of bright colours  tulips daffodils hyacinths  holland in april 
the bulrush curtsy  in the wake of the lagoon  while the houses sleep 
i know now why did   dinosaurs become extinct   please wash your hands often 
the change desired  will remain a fantasy  if not for action 
my first recession  retail stores furlough thousands  glad i own no stock 
sea and salt and stone  caress me raw and screaming  loving me to death 
growing starvation   a willy in the white house   enjoying the game 
cutting and frying  onions based meat melodies  while the veggies soar 
hi there philip glass  please can you play the same thing  again and again 
the lewd attire is  envious of loveliness  wearing modesty 
her garden flourished  in the flowering plate ware  dug up from yard sales 
through deep black  dim moonlight on snow  outlines the branches 
sometimes some things rhyme  other times they just dont try   this is one such time 
death acts life reacts  spend time turning looking back  memories along the track 
moralless orange  souring things all around  can we just squeeze him 
lips turn up forced smile  what other choice did i have  i am fine thank you 
i speak to the stars   about my deepest secrets   when will they speak back 
do not give new names  to historic and sacred  pilgrim remember 
motes drift unseen  sunlight seeps through   boarded up windows 
you wake up alone  go throughout your day alone  fall asleep alone 
we met in the spring  fell in love in the summer  and died in winter 
halloween retreats  christmas on the horizon  but first thanksgiving 
racial policy  purity über alles  just common sense folks 
cold winter fingers  wrapped in a down comforter  sleep creeps through the house 
spring games with the moon   playing hide and seek all night   i've never won once 
motörhead kicks ass  girl love me like a reptile  the hammers comin' 
now orange embraced  forgotten are scenes of green  sweetly sour serene 
a new fruit dangling  precious food not yet formed  will it persevere 
starbuck are racists  people are too sensitive  make mine a latte 
a song of sorrow   yet promises a great truth   twenty one pilots 
i see the ice is  slowly melting here comes the  sun and it's all right 
spirits of my past  ink'd across my page of life  a tattoo of guilt 
pet insecticide   cat chases roach  round the room   that bug met his doom 
the weekend is here  now is the time to relax  oh wait it's monday 
from out of the woods  a young dog seeks his master  are we not both lost 
the wind on my face  thoughts of what it may carry  holding my breath 
i want you to know  i miss our time together  those fleeting moments 
dashing through the snow  ho ho ho he yells aloud  fat drunk homeless man 
a mother struggles   in silence she pleas for help   but silence she finds 
eating taco bell  i will punish my toilet  no regrets today 
the sweet springtime sunshine  twinkles down through the leaves onto  our smiling faces 
up the interstate  a plunge to make your skin blue  home before midnight 
slowly at first glance  then suddenly all at once  like the sunrise love 
the first amendment  does not apply to hate speech  unless you hate trump 
what part of my gift  is the uplifting of my  dull and drowsy eyes 
a walk in sunshine  side by sideyour presencejoy  sweet recollections 
snow goes wherever  the wind says wind says to go  north the snow goes south 
crazy in this cell  should i be scared of my voice   or just the echo 
mind stuck in the clouds   shy and lonely as i breathe   forever alone 
we both saw the spark   a chance to make light for us   but the darkness stayed 
over indulgence  wincing at patchy flashbacks  fuck i do that for 
the sad truth of life   all that is good is fleeting   we are slaves to time 
i miss you so much  it's so hard without you here  papi please come back 
ville and the girl  summer sun flapping curtain  she can never stay 
visiting this place  memories are tangible  i still see your face 
a walk down waikiki   even the chickadees here   give tourists a show 
tears form in my eyes  you touch all the right places  while i beg please don't 
bustling white sidewalks  displaced coyotes howl  slink through midnight streets 
a rope is hanging   swaying what shoul i do hmm   maybe just maybe 
sunshine on my face  words and chords in melody  a rare breath of life 
celebrate the day  of a roman's beheading  by sending candy 
picketing a saint  with signs of the cross and a  novena of prayer 
lessons learned again  wisdom to grow more more more  an ultimate form 
a haiku collab  writeabadhaikucom  hope you enjoy it 
cold pale and numb toes  painful walk to the dryer  full of single socks 
one chance to explain  and the monster you run from  will quickly be slain 
fire in each motion  wasting away so slowly  rage is what is left 
two bit deceivers  pour out their twisted hearts  their love is broken 
my life of service  in my bucket love of you  praise to god each day 
towards light we wander  seeking and always circling  dreaming our moth dreams 
his balls were dangling  like the golden apples of  the eternal tree 
i see your eyes shine  does your mouth smile wide for me   o to laugh with you 
mistakesdon't look back  learn from them change grow and love  how can i serve you 
some say love is true   some say love is all you need   i just want a glimpse 
hollow hulled and lost  you freeze frame in my clear mind  forever strolling out 
scrap of white paper   soft words crumpled and tossed away   summer rain begins 
two big empty hearts  a good day to stay in bed  a room filled with us 
at the age   of little boy   the big moon 
the roots of tall trees  rise up from the earthen floor  reclaiming their home 
the autumn wind blows  her face numb and heart broken  he never showed up 
face in your pillow  it once meant something to you  now it's just for rent 
ironically  the best and worst thing about  you was your damned mouth 
i came to know you   but only biblically   not how it matters 
mandalorian   baby yoda is so cute   thanks jon favereau 
far away in bold  desire quenching thirst in spring  reckless autumn comes 
shut up mama gump   it's more like tv channels   not chocolate boxes 
the cold wind blows hard   against a weak little plant   uprooting it all 
let the vengeful sky  loose silver arrows of rain  on my umbrella 
cold covered in snow  my heart slows for a moment  until i see you 
dry leaves descending  settling gently on the earth  crumbling into dust 
don't worry you'll say  that is how it always ends  like i know it will 
tattered plastic bag  ribboned across barbed wire  anger carves up skin 
poured my heart onto a page  an ocean of thought  two droplets deep it drowned 
a botched waste of time  days sink like stones in water  muted clock hands wane 
another whiskey  darkness calm cool soothing grip  never waking up 
thousand miles apart  two souls searched for a meaning  they found each other 
feel empty in gut  revolving days go away  stuck in a deep rut 
hours drift downstream   i chase them daily but fall   into tommorow 
the groundhog had not  seen his mischievous shadow  why is it snowing 
often we have loved  ever bound body spirit  journey united 
the light flickers low   there is no night for these dreams   or bed to sleep in 
reforging a sword  that comes back like a nature  after every war 
a god shakes his head  a child cries for his mother  still just as empty 
the blackbird calls out  his soft song gentle and sad  he is calling her 
watercolor lights  illume the sleeping city  as whippoorwills mourn 
to kindergarten  i googled the difference  between duck and goose 
she is the night time   it is there no matter what   the moon makes me happy 
i love you so much  that i would enjoy burning   just to be your light 
someone called the cops  so they all got off the bus  wonder what they did 
my heart overflows  a babbling brook of sorrow  though tears stream faster 
me myself and i  what the fuck do i do now  get a second job 
i am just a leaf  and history a river  carry me a while 
country boy dirt road   silhouetted trees dusk sky   sunset glows sunroof 
black hood on my head  broken rules and soft crying  death of the haiku 
talkin' 'bout big mike  patrick ewing in a dress  michelle obama 
loneliness is what  you put in your coffee now  to keep you going later 
we can only hope  that a dark reddit ui  will brighten the mood 
the shy pink blossom  her colours show what could be  lighthouse of beauty 
night skies are a bloom  aurora borealis  happiness above 
anger leading you  prayer given up for you  on my knees this day 
i carry around  a box of melancholy  it gets out sometimes 
imminent failure  the world is spiraling down  the same way i am 
what is there to lose   tell the ones you want to love  or risk silence 
facts truths and wisdom  soundbites headlines and boredom  where is my compass 
together at last  the earth no longer holds my soul  as it once did yours 
i can't handle this  take all of my broken tears  my heart can't take this 
tremble at your touch  this unbearable feeling   ecstatic release 
it's nearly five  in need of her husband  stricken by sickness 
past is history  present is what we make of  unwritten future 
brown curls wild and free  he roars under the hot sun  king of the playground 
buff buffalo buff  buffalo buff buffalo  buff buff buffalo 
i'm writing again  after eight long years of doubt  caused by a teacher 
surprised and challenged  my plans interrupted now  praying for wisdom 
murmur of the brook  drowns out the sounds of highways  once your feet get wet 
paralyzed my mind  asked my brain yet heard my heart  sucker for those eyes 
two amputations  no insurance it cost me  an arm and a leg 
heart filled singing  filled my soul with love  penetrated endured enjoyed 
yesterday revealed  bones under my flowerbed  today they have bloomed 
ungrateful spirits   rebel freely to their end   my lord please break me 
she meets him at night  and he hikes up her plaid skirt  fireflies dance til dawn 
hello mister cloud  perhaps you are a missus  please lend us some help 
at the wishing well  yesterday you were crying  and today you smile 
fame is a poison  created by a demand  to escape our lives 
even the soft breeze   brings invisible peril   when will we be safe 
a spark leads to fire  leads to passion and desire  forging trust and love 
after the drive in  pouring rain they were stretching  and segmented home 
astrological entity  illuminating my night  my beautiful moon 
dark and oppressive  thunder echoing away  lightning clouds no rain 
strange green oozing puss  boy this haiku is sure gross  good thing it's so short 
i took out the trash   and left the confines of home   an exciting day 
a slice and a cut  a terrible self hatred  washed away with tears 
wake with a numb arm  feel as the blood flows back in  know that you're alive 
i guess i like you  you can do wierd things to me  i guess i dont care 
suicidal thoughts  drown it all out with vodka  swallow rinse repeat 
the mirror's not wrong  white hair is mingling with black  i blinked and got old 
cat smiling beguiling  sleepy indolent and fat  stretches for a scratch 
what is now to do  no more sorrow to end it  fleeting pain i am 
illumination  bright speech of the brave and just  read about in books 
taking up a space  versus filling up a void  a world of difference 
day and day and day  flows away in silver streams  moonbeams paint my way 
depression filled eyes  forced smile to be polite  on camera all night 
her eyes warm deep pools  i'm fearing i'll drown in them  a death worth dying 
eyeing his stomach  i anticipated breaths  but they never came 
the grim reaper shove  unyielding with sirens and  screaming through traffic 
you say those sad words  now we are strangers again  i steal a last kiss

swirls of pink and white   petals of chrysanthemum   scattered on the ground 
hey how's it going  just social lubrication  no one really cares 
parental fights choked  nutrients of peace and love  so he uprooted 
distractions abound  this phone i never put down  screw reality 
one day i saw it  the ghost of standing there  just my reflection 
sun on the fields  england awakes from winter  spring is upon us 
sweet shady spring moon   dousing the burning day's sun   bringing frog choirs 
they sit still stares locked  different stories one home  my weird family 
listless i wander  with no clear intention i'm lost  in more ways than one 
hazy perplexed eyes  stung by venom of the sun  watered by the light 
tingles of pleasure  imagination eyes closed  it's sensational 
the plan was all set   but the body did not care   who's really in charge 
incredible sights  glory praise and love to god  struck with awe this day 
the sun past zenith  consciousness awakening  he grabs his smartphone 
my breath is caught on   the words i wish i could say   silence burns my skin 
when i disappear  will i even cross your mind  not that it matters 
roses are quite red   violets are quite violet too   i really hate you 
a road trip a game  a shot a run in the rain  never got enough 
an old tarnished key   rusts on the stone house's steps   yet you still knock 
october's last eve  only the full moon  shows its true face 
please protect your ears  tinnitus kinda sucks ass  trust me i would know 
slow breaths in the storm  crashing waters threaten you  stand embrace anew 
rasping breath now fades  deaths rattle shakes the cold room  time to say goodbye 
raindrops on the roof  eucalyptus in the air  lower back massage 
sometimes i long for  my plane's paper wings please  take me far away 
anger begets love  midsummer is ours once more  ripples on a pond 
living in two worlds  reality and our minds  are they both as real 
parenthood is like  reliving pasts knowing all  but you don't listen 
the tree sways slowly   bowing gently to the wind   strong yet so humble 
cigarette smoke curls   ashes fall lungs uncaring   smile we are broken 
sun baked summer stroll  to the hidden lakeside cove  cool wind up her skirt 
i know it's painful  don't vibe with you any more  please leave me alone 
angel in my life  angel aid when most needed  angel i love you 
get out of my head  it's futile critical miss  reciprocation 
spinning skipping stones  plotting the ripples they'll make  though they cannot swim 
oh to love the world  it's beauty transpires in you  lover wrapped in gold 
eyes of emerald   sunsets end in shimmer flare   starry nights with you 
afternoon cloud burst  floods the lonely alleyway  she pours out cold tea 
smile at strangers  watch eyes brighten and lips curl  such a little thing 
a somber midnight  a lover looks to the sky  he wishes for her 
my love for you grew  like a vine around my throat  entangled and lost 
cups by windows are  always fuller than the cups  stored in the cupboard 
the mermaid song got me  crawling under my skin with every note  my ship lost at sea 
did not take notice  of events that went before  should have had hindsight 
warm embers crackling  melachonly in the air  changing of seasons 
nothing to no one   cacophony of crickets   a restless ego

you won't believe i  love you if you can't believe  you are lovable 
can't pay attention  adderal for all the kids  we can't sleep at night 
my soul overflows  it knew not of your magic  and cant drink enough 
shimmering on skin  remnants of a battlefield  small silvery scars 
beer more beer   glasses filled to the brim   now my head hurts 
going unnoticed  winding paths never crossing  gazing somewhere else 
most folks intend good  our actions don't define us  only mistakes teach 
why do we move at  the speed of light through time but   can't do this through space 
just let me sleep in  no point getting up early  it's winter here now 
traps set and capture  knowing well does not free me  your love rescues me 
her smile sweeps the cloud  that he forgets he has lungs  that his legs have knees 
who do we accuse  why do we deserve this fate  what will we become 
i shot for the moon  at first was sad that i missed  ended up a star 
shining blindingly   radiance gleeming brightly   beauty everlast 
a man was killed  a country now burns all  for a fake jackson 
old wounds  that i still keep fresh   to feel something atleast 
at dawn my last song   while sun danced on my skin   as breath flies away 
the gray winter sky   now mirrors my state of mind   darker each moment 
on great a'tuin's cheek  a silver tear is rolling  big as an ocean 
at the register  it looms six away from me  masked identity 
today i failed you  good intentions unfulfilled  begging forgiveness 
strike click boom  roadblock lead to buildups  build ups lead to explosive force 
look at all the pain  there has to be a heaven  because this is hell 
memories of you   a gift to last a lifetime   short as it may be 
first drowning in text  eventually swimming  finally informed 
i feel waking up  im dead as i roam the world  nothing left inside 
people are simple  they just want love and kindness  i've got both for days 
beating ceaseless pain  guilt now torment tomorrow  hope drowned in anguish 
parobolic arc  moving at a unknown speed  the swingset is blue 
i woke to the sun   the morning was veiled in grays   i knew it was there 
they will not help me  the rainclouds cover the world  with the rain of pain 
tainted spring water  life brings death cleanse before use  punish the guilty 
hours fall away  but still i law here awake  i can't help myself 
her hair is an ode   to joy to happiness to   such silk soothes old souls 
nobel warrior  tell me all of your secrets  or else feel my blade 
post traumatic stress   the feeling that your repressed   suddenly undressed 
i'm lonely she said  please come over i miss you  to a dial tone 
struggle bares great weight  find the courage buried deep  beneath the frost line 
you earn what you keep  and you get what you deserve  that's the fucking truth 
my friends never end  not knowing why some people  continue singing 
once upon a time  at the end of a rainbow  i sold pot for gold 
a lot can happen  in seven months but i sure  didn't expect this 
hugging ancient walls  a thousand ages pass by  constant unyielding 
it's getting near dawn  when lights close their tired eyes  i'll soon be with you 
on the brink of tears  i reach out i need you now  but you are not here 
i cannot fathom  a memory without you  but i wish i could 
old man bumps his head  long grey hair begins to bloom  snores the day away 
worry behind now  eyes front with hope love service  step ahead with joy 
sweeping silhouettes   swooping through the fallen leaves   masking strange creatures 
it never mattered  what i don't know about you  you deserve to smile 
i remember love  her touch surreal fleeting  her wrath enduring 
the temporal vows  are taken by a moth for  a cloistered cocoon 
a buried treasure  high with hope for gems within  unlocked with prayer 
help me i am trapped  in a haiku factory  save me before they 
descent into hell  from out of this we can rise  hope in every breath 
may civility  prevail here at this humble  human and dog park 
in your absence i   spoke to the leaves they listened   until the fall came 
i glare in contempt  a supposed record store  no fucking slipknot 
raindrops on the roof  eucalyptus in the air   lower back massage 
many fish ahead  time to steer toward the sun  this storm has no eye 
ben misses the bus  splashes around in his pond  there is no escape 
mezmerising eyes  gazing upon another  i can only stare 
at bubble tea store  vodka with tapioca  less ice half sugar 
standing at the door   and waiting for your letter   leaves are falling down 
yesterday's a dream  tomorrow doesn't exist  today's the present 
separate from springtime  i can see my reflection  a bird call breaks through 
standing on the peak  your words taken by the wind  together alone 
a main artery  clotted in the accident  shouldering a wreck 
found pearl at airport  the owner i could not find  my wife won't wear it 
the rain is falling  you can hear it on the roof  better together 
at first sight in love  moving closer the strobe lights  hint at ruins to come 
smiles joy engulf me  faith love cover your battles  thanking god for you 
pulling away now   moving on for the better   leaving those who used 
my path is not clear  i no longer look for love  i ask for guidance 
wisdom of the pines  we must burn to be reborn  from my lips to yours 
blinded by the white  numbed to the bone by such cold  comfort in your love 
bacon on my plate  wait  what no that's not bacon  what did i just eat 
hung from white clover  wiggles in the wilderness  six thin legs push free 
a fleeting sun lights  a fire across the sky  the world welcomes it 
i predicted mess  just not sure how deep let's see  what the cards say next 
i forgive you self   you don't have to keep faking   they will still love you 
a winter sparrow  perched still on a backflow pipe  joggers feet take flight 
quarantine is now  life as we know it is new  isolation sucks 
sunshine and moonlight   complimenting and contrasting   ruling both day and night 
we are just the egg   of a phoenix called frienship  they live forever 
blue is more the blue  presence partly manifests  thinner places loom 
the old farm pond  used to be a swimming hole  reclaimed by flora 
finding your purpose  break free from reality  search the soul within 
trembling in desire  you tease me with your fingers  deadly is your touch 
houses surrendered  trapped by icy daggers as  winter surrounded 
dog farts in the night   oh god it smells so damn bad   silent but deadly 
darkness fills the night   regret surounds me with fear   sorrow pulls me down 
insomnia suck   because you can feel spiders   crawling down your throat 
the rain pours loudly  giving plants their energy  while others will drown 
isn't it funny how   my life is worth so little   until it leaves theirs 
five five five five five   seven seven seven six   five five five five five 
battle intellect  not getting personal yet  how mad can you get 
you are perfect love  you give all of it to me  you will perfect me 
i know you miss me  but i'm just bones in a box  you have to move on 
to quit you would be  breaking bones to reset them  i can't do it yet 
my thoughts whish away  the blossoms gone to the wind  lost in forever 
my last was a fail   i hope that i can improve   with time and practice 
love from an earbud  speaking from a choice of song  head on my shoulder 
cut words from my lungs   ugly shards strangled in vines   spilling over all 
a morning coo breaks  the sky heaven is blissful  i birdwatch til night 
would you sit with me   noone would sit with me soul  afraid sat alone 
dust you will become  but will someone chant your name  soft as i do hers 
ghost in my machine  your black lillies by my door  animal crossing 
sippy cylinder  use paper not one plastic  save environment 
stardust fills my veins  the witching hour calls to me  it is spellbinding 
the light of the sun  sets over my time and soul  soon i will be free 
fragments of a thought  like jigsaw puzzle pieces  in my scattered mind 
waves breaking with blue  salt sticking to skin and hair  sand blowing through air 
wow i am so bored  i can't think of things to do  send more coffee please 
alone in a crowd  do not trust those jeering faces  a cheerful facade 
the taste of alone  beckons to me so sweetly  back to that silence 
should too the fungus  mourn over the death on which  it perseveres 
this cube is haunted  nerd ghosts materialize  asking for slide rules 
the old man at work   constantly repeats himself   evil dementia 
creativity  the new daily grind no more  imagination 
flowers in the breeze  perseverance or hunger  tiny wings take flight 
floured countertop  old memories and big laughs  facetime with a friend 
her lips like storm clouds  above me raining kisses  each one like lightning 
shaking my fists at a blank wall  i am not here  i am an object 
being an asshole  is a symptom of your fake  gluten allergy 
on the verge of event horizon  daydreaming  homesick of the void 
snow falls so slowly  you thrown dart into my heart  blood has colored sea 
two seagulls sunning  frigid still air unmoving  dull blue sky above 
in the dark closet  my umbrellas hibernate  during the winter 
fear not citizens   the symbol of peace is here   california smaaaaaash 
silver desert moon  i know a lonely woman  stars whisper her name 
i am sorry cat  we have run out of meat treats  she sits patiently 
exposed emotions  in a superposition  just won't collide 
a pinch of sadness  springkled with melancholy  it's a bit sucky 
the madening past  unsure of the old future  see saws like always 
fingerprint bruises  roll down a small freckled arm  thunder booms at night 
the sea might be deep  but even if it's endless  your eyes make him shy 
a roasted pheasant  a warm fire in our homes  don't think 'bout them bums 
waiting i did try  impatience oh impatience   you got me again 
the pawns and the queen  are all under the same box  after the chess game 
i will not be told  whom to love or whom to hate  i will wed a child 
the grim black harvest  the black seeds are ever sown  the reapers embrace 
when there was a chance  i was dismissed forsaken  what can a man say 
your pain well hidden  behind the smilein your eyes  here to help you love 
inspiration now  i saw two seagulls passing  strong winds filled my soul 
a slice of lemon  and fizzing water is a  great combination 
an amber sunrise  the wind blows my stress away  now life is perfect 
i am stuck at work  it makes me sad to be here  dreaming of craft beer 
never satisfied  allure of the unknown   what it is you seek 
what an argument  even if i use reason  he does not listen 
golden sands sit calm   where the moon meets the ocean   the cycle complete 
my dirty secret  i always count my fingers  when i write haikus 
they speak in untruths   the anti vax parents  oh no a disease 
haikus are easy  but do not always make sense   refrigerator 
caught by ceaseless waves  the shore painfully nearby  but im too tired 
mom named me alex james  dad used to hit on my mom  now they have sex lots 
fire sparks and engulfs   howls of an unknown design   shifting before i 
jacket and beanie  sun climbing high in the sky  i am overdressed 
old eyes in old wives  glazed over and sunken through  watching his approach 
one cloud  so large  it might as well be sky 
today it's raining  tomorrow bright sunshine  ah english weather 
i want to eat shit   coprophage degradation   i am your toilet 
the strongest of trees   still require some nourishment   every now and then 
her steely gaze cuts  through my exoskeleton  end of transmission 
at first physical  then followed by deep passion  now mother of two 
now fall summer through  someone new replacing you  jerk off in a sock 
under the lampposts  yellow dim light shining right  she brightens my night 
his brown house on fire   i sip my spare cocktail shocked   when'd he get a dog 
i've got some questions  teacher of love can you help  i never understand 
don't eat for hunger   just because i know i must   pot noodle at uni 
the only limits  constraining my destiny  are the ones i make 
i can see you now  for just what you really are  i'm glad you are gone 
pills booze broken glass  hear birds chirping but alas  they can seize the day 
your tearsnow my tears  love shared for so many years  hold me tight my love 
i think of success  yet all i see is failure  what do i do next 
trapped at home i dream  my imagination wanders  but i remain still 
dizzying these heights  your arm around my shoulder  i'm glad that it's you 
goddess give me strength  the burning times are nearing  greedy little flames 
the computer's screen  illuminating my face  another restless night 
a long vacation  most left unpaid and hungry  yet no border wall 
there i found myself  on the edge of the water  as i drink deeply 
as we grow older  we must be mindful to love  deep open and free 
struggling enduring  the black swordsman has arrived  hunting the god hand 
seven syllables   sandwiched by two lines of five   haiku dna 
nothing he can do  to make me want him as much  as how i want you 
water trickles down  garden of many colours  see them all year round 
softly spoken words   fail to reach your covered ears   shall i scream them then 
but you'd be surprised  the epiphanies you find  in another's life 
the rain falls gently  last weekend's snow is washed clean  more snow on the way 
lost soul wandering  a good place to stop tonight  not there idiot 
boldly i acted  you taught me well and it shows  wonderful are we 
i needed to poop   i made it to the toilet   a moment too late 
anniversary  if only she was still here  unfillable void 
the eye in the sky  is a great source of comfort  until it isn't 
a moment's silence  a brief reflection of life  found in death's sadness 
tired and torn socks  products of your gruelling run  i took a long sniff 
just stop it would you  i want to be free of that  apple cart stirrer 
i hate going out  to see people because then  i'd have to wear bra 
fear like air   every breath   suffocate without lungs 
in armour and veil  her view of the world is grim  lest her guard dissolves 
happy treason day  corrupted rotting country  celebrate nothing 
at work i am asked   where do we go for lunch time   a great mystery 
lost broken comforts  darting salmon in my heart  hardest section feelings 
melancholic fall   a mere serene ghost gazes  standing before a tree 
it was a long walk home  when you set me free  prayed a car would crash in me 
mom's words spill freely  memory leaves taste of booze  reminder she's human 
i hear its passage  the whistle of time fleeting  ears deaf in its gust 
night falls on a field  lights flicker like stars above  fireflies dance with grace 
mid life miasma  veering into the slow pain  complex diagram 
northern lights calling   will i ever get to see  beauty in person 
mistakes in our past  sometimes we don't forget them  but we always learn 
life's drudgery i feel  traffic snarls and honks make me realise  this city is now my cage 
live on cnn  very unprofessional  so close watch your step 
a footprint in mud  is it at all permanent  shall it fade away 
this crushing ordeal  is testing my limits but  what if it's a gift 
i came to you friend  we spoke but did i listen  our eyes said it all 
the fifth of july  message read but unanswered  fireworks are thru 
it is a war crime  to destroy cultural sites  instead of humans 
been outside a lot   now i have a mask tan line   a strange two tone face 
tears stinging my eyes  falling down with warm feeling  alas still numb inside 
after a harsh wind  maples take off their red garb  exposing true form 
rising from the earth  pushing upward falling back  we wave hi and bye 
set me free tonight  for a moment i'll forget  this reality 
here it comes again  i can think of nothing worse  money in the bank 
to climb mt juji  more than once or not even  is my biggest fear 
reflect on the past  my sorrow leaves it's slumber  eternal drowning 
the hills rolling by   and his scent fills the cabin   swift brush on my leg 
breezing in for lunch  crunchy potato salad  and swallowing sand 
ever just listen   soak up sounds of summer rain  cleansing your spirit 
balloons overhead  villagers scamper about  animal crossing 
and i dreamt i died  but with time to drive around  and say my goodbyes 
excellent morning  perfect elevator moves  in spite of the floors 
my misery craves  a leave from my company  yet it lacks courage 
what is remembered  when death's shadow looms nearby  is it love laughter 
story worth reading  earns bookmark in its pages  to maintain progress 
consensus inverts  the logic of rational  decision making 
this is abhorrent  ziploc bag brimming with pills  that is malpractice 
politics above   we wash our clothes in silence   i am out of coins 
nights slow song croaks by  stars rolling in black wet flow  day's flies digesting 
plans interrupted  your needs i serviced today  love is all it took 
woke up with night sweats   groping my way to light switch   damn nightmares again 
there is a relief  knowing the limb brought no loss  squid nor octopus 
too late for tulips  puddles draw out snails and frogs  honeysuckle spring 
the kaiju appears  behold humanity's end  king of the monsters 
for a whirlybird  the singular resolve is  exalting humans 
sweet with brown sugar  peaches and cream or berries  quaker oats is king 
the rain unrelenting  my thoughts thaw to follow  steps falter from thought 
repetition kills  the same again and again  day in and day out 
hot morning coffee  steam rising over my nose  dark out peaceful and quiet 
that's a girl i know  must keep staring to know  the answer was no 
how sweet is your voice  a timbre stamped on my soul  love within each word 
you have cast your pearls   are too beautiful for swine   they don't understand 
fast ships run tight lines  through the bellowing breakers  no time for the sea 
time eases some hurt  you will be happy again  slowly and surely 
lay back and relax  kissing everywhere i love  i want to taste you 
rays hit my window   living under quarantine   longing for outside 
in my bed  i cry laugh bleed love  live and die 
on a day of thanks  warm wishes to a neighbor  positive and bright 
i had a baby  actually my wife did  it's cramping my style 
i'm a bitter fuck  the feel of your skin lingers  it's killing me 
cold like winter wind  they played me and betrayed me  trust broken no hope 
how i wish i could  tell her just how i still feel  if she were not cruel 
over shoulder checks  paranoid just like raw sex  tweaking need a fix 
tubing down st croix  spinning round current guiding  through hoops of fire 
cherry blossoms  blooming pink in white  warm winters delight 
we prose the mistake  a yet to be corrected  value the progress 
your inspiration  a path hidden is revealed  my way for today 
the phone is still dead  no answering machine flash  lonely at blackout 
played spin the bottle  with one thumb on the throttle   no foot on the brake 
a winter twilight  in wyoming crystalized  breaths filling the air 
putting others first  they are taught that you come last  not your place in life 
sunrise in your mind  illuminating your dreams  may it never set 
cis men point fingers  telling me their conclusions  without listening 
third street rose  sitting by the register  wilting in the steam 
five dollars a month  after the thirty day trial  will auto renew 
blaze of glory  like any other rental  i treat this body 
sun is out schorching   cooking eggs on the pavement   true playas only 
called in the plumber  when i observed his buttocks  got quite excited 
good old monday booze  loaning tuesday's happiness  good old monday blues 
wake up to shouting  how do i turn down the noise  sleep in your hallway 
every hero fears  that some rapt admirer will  learn the awful truth 
me you together  just like birds of a feather  beyond forever 
i wasted my life  marching ahead for nothing  now i'm in prison 
flurry of vile words  and now i'm at a crossroad   do i stay or go 
how can i thank you  never have you failed me lord  come holy spirit 
sometimes i feel down  during those moments i breathe  i dream of mountains 
distractiondiversioninterruption  prayer restores focus on goal  grace receivedthanks 
addiction worships  hymnals in hallucinate  patron saint of fix 
keeping real busy  stuck in a modern jail cell  within my own home 
surface gets hotter  ill shove you under water  never let you drown 
first ospreys of the season  rebuilding their nest  bay tide at low ebb 
fight the break of dawn  girl you know i've got to go  tomorrow i'll be 
escaped from its cage  my heart knows my mind enslaved  the length of my days 
often i ponder  the question with no answer  that would satisfy 
with love in my heart  thank you serendipity  i have my candee 
in my back pocket  breaking in this new notebook  it hurts my ass 
the snowball season  with strawberry flavor at  summer festivals 
shapes colors and sounds   a dot in the void of space   is that all life is 
surprised by your love  warmed embraced communed touched felt  an island of joy 
whispers pink and white  wind through swaying green arches  a blue summer sigh 
life can be so hard  every gets easier  with your hand in mine 
watch me count to five  zero one two three four five  i can count to five 
her tempest has been  walloping the trees as they  bend from the blowing 
pilgrims journeying  eternity awaits us  love faith lead each day 
social distancing  vacate your whole social life  madness fills that void 
a smirk in the dark  cheap dress peeled off in silence  petals float away 
buzz of conversation  exotic spices wafting  candlelight and wine 
with frightening ease  my deepest desire obscured  all things contrary 
you lead me on down  alley cats bang clang below  to screaming pleasure 
life chugging down the track  absurdism hits from nowhere   derailed and not be rescued 
two cars meet collide  spirit curiosity  traffic jam on mars 
let my focus drift   metronome ceiling fan clicks   i'm no musician 
writing a haiku  counting the syllables now  i am successful 
the phoenix rises  from the ash and so will you  failure is the start 
a single yip had  set off the yowling and it  avalanched through yards 
a vague gesture at  feelings may not give meaning  but satisfaction 
warm and tender thighs  juice on my chin like raindrops  k f c bucket 
fireflies in the night  little sparks moving about  so peaceful to watch 
god i am humbled  amazed by you filled with grace  ever thanking you 
inside i'm screaming  no sounds will i make out loud  silence must endure 
head is filled with bees   bees waiting to be released   release lies ahead 
the deafening sound   of the stream   a reflection of god 
empty glass like trees  the sun had set there is no   moon silence then dogs 
i can see sunshine   i want to live forever   please stay better days 
dieting is rough  soda is the enemy   eat vegetables 
a chorus of frogs  peeping out their springtime in  a soprano bog 
this old photograph  the last remaining vestige  of a long lost love 
sigh and giggle merge  new adventure in her eyes  a dotted life note 
i saw a hunter  on election day we were  civil how bout that 
i cannot count sheep  no matter how hard i try  there will be no sleep 
silence chokes and kills  much like broken promises   she was good at that 
you were in a dream  i saw your warm smile again  why did i wake up 
restless jab at keyboard  lady in blue caught my eye  haiku on the anvil 
a new sensation  electrical connection  to the universe 
warrior spirit  lost among technology  where pens become swords 
i will not be told  whom to love or whom to hate  i'll marry a man 
far across the expanse  where pens and papers divorced  i left words for you 
you changed your gender  my feelings remain the same  i still hate your guts 
silver moonlight falls  through the heat of summer night  landing on bare skin 
they work at the task  of braiding the rope of cords  that will mark their neck 
i don't know if   i should laugh or cry at how   bad i'm at chess 
but you always thought   she would never betray you   and yet here we are 
temple of the dog  before you an offering  come out for kibble 
we may starve to death  but at least we won't run out  of toilet paper 
tears run down my cheeks  emotions bubbling up  like a soda can 
why is it this close  let me off this crazy ride  mom come pick me up 
die hard christmas film   some say it is some say not   the latter are wrong 
when i hear you sing   heart dances to the rhythm   of your melody 
the days spent shit faced  an inexorable march  blue clouds of evening 
mom leave me alone  i screamed the next morning  she really did 
deepening in dark   compressing into nothing   swallowed up and whole 
bright eyes sharpened talons  feathers mute sounds of approach  owl catches its prey 
i am not okay  negative thoughts fill my brain  i want this to end 
puer natus est  gloria in excelsis  et in terra pax 
studying beauty  clever delicate concise  gently stalk haiku 
cold winter evenings  nature grows fully tranquil  the silence deafens 
a rainbow appears  colorful array in sky  natural wonder 
it was loneliness  a subtle isolation  now found drunk in maine 
my legs feel like shit  i talk shit i look like shit  fuck what is this shit 
lone samurai speaks  his fallen brethren listen  sound of painful tears 
fading memories  you can't hold on they fly off  like butterflies 
withered roses  i pick the petals  one by one 
fear seeks to take hold  hope in love given received  mercy forgiveness 
white collar prison  too few inches but it's nice  the ass is half full 
there are no limits  when i reach the highest peak  i will learn to fly 
which one to order  neither will make me happy  i'll aim for least sad 
fuck me fuck my life  i need to get back to it  life in studio 
my head was heavy  now i'm light as a feather  walking on soft clouds 
bury the mud path  with fallen flower blossoms  warmth to heal winter 
enormous pressure  flood waters threaten to burst   no release dammed 
white streaks across the  sunrise move people around  tiers of combustion 
my wounds left unhealed   employed time as my doctor   still i am bleeding 
be in my light friend  feel the rhythm of my soul  my love be your guide 
don't look at the sun  shining bright from cheek to cheek  a glorious smile 
evil lingers here   in the exceptions we make   unlearn support love 
nothing i believe   is really worth believing   and that's my belief 
noose around his neck   eyes clear like the full moon   a schizo's dream 
postal service must  turn a profit unlike the  air force and navy 
what we all want now  may not be what we want then  make smart decisions 
core breach imminent  suit up and get to atmo  captain signing off 
when i am with you  we exchange intimate glances  full of resentment 
sucked on her boobies  for longer than thirty minutes  she finally came 
the cicadas sing  bedtime songs while night recalls  the promise of day 
cotton families  in a billowy hello  wave on laundry lines 
happiness abounds  feeding my faith starves my fear  hungry am i lord 
refrigerator  i like refrigerators  refrigerator 
looking at nature   holding your perfume fingers   this is beautiful 
what the future holds  noone knows in certainty   so why be afraid 
in my search for truth  i found the truth had missed me  a deceptive search 
you deserve the silk  say the creatures who wove it  out of their asses 
went to montreal  go yelled at about parking  so i up and left 
hand in hand we walk  but there is no time to talk  you are leaving me 
stop telling me why  let me breathe don't say goodbye  just leave let me grieve 
whiteboards are so cool  you wipe them clean and write more  they're remarkable 
the evergreen tree  bundled up in silk and stars  kindles dormant hearts 
when the fire dies down  take some charcoal in your hand  draw the world from scratch 
my heart is ice cold  love escapes for the last time  i'm ready to die 
on the windowsill  poking stinger now is stilled  knightly flyer killed 
motionless city  a young weary nurse slumbers  dreaming of the sun 
pain inside my soul   broken heart or broken bone   difference is none 
running from failure  chasing a dream of success  neither brings me joy 
simple words sound lame   eloquent words insincere   silence sounds hollow 
sunlight through curtains  peeping in to touch my face  now i am awake 
death is eternal  life is but a few moments  live in those moments 
you died too young dad  nicotine stole you away  and attacked my heart 
i saw a kayote once at night   silhouetted beautifulblack   trimmed in silver by the moon 
spring forward  then we all fall back  craziness 
oceans wave to me  haha sea what i did there  no pun intended 
the mightier pen  despite all achievements makes  a worthless ploughshare 
the moon above us  stars shining through the shadows  twilight horizons 
aimless wanderer  i am without home or kin  an unwanted stray 
why is it so cold  the sky is clear and quite blue  ice and snow come soon 
a flurry of words  beckon for my attention  which ones will i choose 
after sixteen years  finally able to start  paying stundent dept 
homo sapien  thinking with his frontal lobe  thinks he's so damn smart 
memories like mist  i have forgotten her laugh  her smile eludes me 
why is it that i  when beginning a poem  always ask questions 
they were never there  bittersweet recollections  their existence passed 
a master's degree  to keep you out of trouble  your life is a lie 
coyote sunset  sky drops from purple to pink  mesa silhouettes 
radiance rays of light pierce through  even the darkest of clouds  behold radiance 
ancient green wilderness  serenity atop the waterfall  home at last 
splinter of sunlight  piercing window screen and shade  this prism dancing 
just thinking of you  endless poems i could write  way beyond haiku 
dandelion seeds  you whirl oh so gracefully  a fuzzy cumshot 
the bus takes me there  by there i mean wherever  too bad i missed it 
a walk through nature  the trees and rocks whisper tales  where does one begin 
help me comb my hair   i got bee honey in it   i say you owe me 
there is a last time  you ever do anything  enjoy the moment 
moments of contact  longing for a foil for me  i miss human touch 
pine cone brown and hard  ever so carefully carved  bonks me on the head 
i stared at the fox  scavenging for his dinner  in him i saw me 
winter lifeless calm  deer tracks imprinted in snow  distant gunshots blast 
winter's breathy joke  exposing fragilities  frigid hearts break hard 
our overlords' whims   are not for our feeble minds   to grasp or question 
ticking of the clock  the drone of the computer  footsteps towards the door 
afar it stretches  a view of hillsides green as   leaves of tea unfold 
your honesty hurts  for surgical enhancements  corrected not healed 
for april fools' day  i'll act like i want to live  because that's funny 
three lines without rhyme  a senryu or haiku  spring breeze the frogs sneeze 
with my pruning shears   my little tree was mangled   check twice and cut once 
center in my mind  dark brew bitter yet so sweet  its tendrils engulf 
i need some new pants  although i did just get some  a new hat instead 
weight on eyes like fog  something in the morning mist  it is now my time 
i thought i fit in   then a thought flew in maybe   i'm just pretendin' 
to find your new peace  be still the mind and let go  of all worry breathe 
you want what now  blossoms droop in your presence  here is your haiku 
assignments due soon  like the plague i avoid them  due date is looming 
still in it's pink cup  an endless wandering passed  the taste of tea leaves 
you want me to rhyme   pfft i ain't got time for that  haikus are less work 
ten baby carrots  three ounces of cold chicken  an apple my lunch 
i cut my ear off  at the van gogh museum  everyone clapped 
another night gone   lost to academia   so starts the new day 
seventeen short words  so little time to confess  my bottomless love 
no matter how great  a power without witness  ceases to exist 
story of a life  trapped in the mind that can't speak  the eyes ache and weep 
tiptoe stretch my love  hamstrings burn for your desire  popcorn needs butter 
two bickering cats  pick them up suggest friendship  hissing cats are sharp 
my pup looks at me  i want to be what they see  someone worth loving 
connected were we  lives touched by truth and beauty  basking in the glow 
the heart drowns today   forgotten in my sorrow   lost within my past 
down with the mod king  they are not doing their job  what is all this tripe 
grey and rainy day  in silence i close my eyes  slowly fall asleep 
i am dishonored   truly regret my choices   i must capture aang 
rustle of some leaves  morning and night ritual  two hundred and twelve 
i believe in love  and i believe in hate too  i wish for balance 
no passport needed  no jet lag or sea sickness  on this kind of trip 
a place of freedom  no judgement or restrictions  just write what you like 
all that disrespect   you show me another when  you shrugged and moved on 
measure your success  with a ruler you create  not someone else's 
easter weekend break   lots of family catch ups   then back to work drained 
little known secrets  when you smile at strangers  great things can happen 
refrigerator  stuff the turkey down your throat  asphyxiation 
lord thy servant writes   please spare others of your wrath   destroy me instead 
plants are phoenixes  burst bloom blaze bend break burn be  so feeds its next self 
a nylon dragon  clawing to the sky with an  appetite for wind 
doing it is just   it will repristinate our  sense of obligation 
a weed edible  it's not working i need more  call an ambulance 
i watch the sun rise  a new day is beginning  yet i live in yore 
can't sleep don't want to  worlds collide and bounce back  i get stuck in both 
engulfed in warm bliss  surrounded by your sweet scent   calming me to rest 
weary exhausted  energy fully depleted  need to recover 
my battery is   low its getting dark i don't   feel good mr stark 
dove cooing alone   branches shaking leafs falling   the ravens crowing 
do we feel the same  is your love the same as mine  can we ever know 
kitty loudly purred  i looked at him and meowed  he wanted cuddles 
i dream of a day  when i will wear flowing white  and walk down that aisle 
courage to declare  the big final step forward  life at next level 
a flower petal  drifts away from yesterday  into tomorrow 
today side by side  we worked as in days gone by  dear let's celebrate 
hawk greets the wind as  the scattering leaves make it  less invisible 
where do wishes go  look at the night sky someday  you'll find them floating 
i will build a wall  to protect myself from god  god will pay for it 
into the unknown  is where my life is heading  send the fifth spirit 
everything you touch  leaves you with a little gift  wash your dirty hands 
things are just fine mom  too ashamed to need help again  i'll call you back soon 
too much stuff to do  not enough hours in the day  waste time anyway 
infowars tells truths  obama turned the frogs gay  now its an old meme 
the rain sings to me   i sleep while water whispers   tonight it's quiet 
water turns to ice  change is afoot as always  time won't wait for you 
the cafe is near  pure and caffeinated  milk is amoral 
i just keep scrolling  endlessly mind numbingly  must stay distracted 
mourning cars filing  past their relative with the  flares lit for candles 
prayers heard answered  now i must give thanks and act  god you are awesome 
how was january   they ask i simply reply   the month just flu by 
tick tock tick tock tick  perpetual thoughts madness  erase suffering 
spins from the gear hums   dim light peeping through my door   restless as pearls stare 
silence has prevailed  in it i feel most at ease  night has come again 
irritated face  red skin angry swollen spots  but i must not touch 
the most brimming fruits  they are always those ones that  are about to fall 
through trees transgressed   sunshine by the bamboo pool   we walk flowered paths 
the pizza is hot  my wife tried to caution me  i still burned my mouth 
i don't like people  only exception is you  you are my person 
mirror on the wall  everything will be alright  so please smile for me 
beneath ancient oaks  i ponder mortality  stillness suspends time 
when dusk settles in  the energy trickles out  and there is nothing 
looking for real love  fairy tale as a kid love  al and jasmin love 
the rain unrelenting  my mind thaws to follow  steps falter from thought 
the fucking bomb y'all  super nova you know it  and know it you do 
with narrowed effort  bereft of dull intentions  he sharpens his craft 
the chopper crashed and  the pilot had ejected  to retrieve his toy 
befuddled confused  bewildered shocked and startled  you leave me speechless 
liquid emotion  paper tainted by the tears  flowing from my pen 
nerves are acting up  my ass must prepare a speech  what he has is shit 
where could that hero be  purgatory for the lost  i pray for his soul 
sometimes a lone stick  grasping out of a clay pot  is enough for me 
a clear reflection  consistent and comforting  quickly came the wind 
blisters under gloves  an afternoon of yard work  feet breathe on the couch 
you think you can run   i'll gobble up your table  you will face judgment 
all traffic equal  house of representatives  follow senate's lead 
telling me stories   i can't even understand   you had to be there 
the shirt smells like you  a scent once so rare but now  tragically common 
every twisted word   a double edged sword in that   blackened heart of yours 
i just want to sleep  my past mistakes don't matter  all i do is think 
meeting on the field  a fox spirit comes along  winter is coming 
a violent thought  hearing voices in the trees  whisper cryptic things 
flutter melody  dart swiftly in morning light   prized possession plucked 
spring petrichor  a black dog quiets with  pin cherries 
words nouns sounds compounds  peanut butter scotch tape worm  fuck i stepped in shit 
autumn days settle  plants and bears prepare for sleep  winter threatens cold 
doot doot doot doot doot  doot doot doot doot doot doot doot  doot doot doot doot doot 
why would god make me  only to hate who i am  something is wrong here 
an afternoon stroll  another hot one today  i should have worn shorts 
heyyyyy heyyyyy kids waving  as we drive past the hay bales  drying in the sun 
gently close my eyes  whispering it will be fine  till i fall asleep 
that feel when you shit  that feel when you take a dump  that feel when you poop 
equilibrium  balance in the universe  as all things should be 
how do you do it  you make colors out of grey  warming my cold heart 
i prometheus   my eagle is this work place   torment eternal 
confidence begins  the person in the mirror  respecting yourself 
oh to be in love  he ardently held her hair  as she puked up vile 
i weep for my youth  days like lifetimes all their own  how bright i burned then 
unproductive day  even slacking off was dull  i blame management 
you just walked away  and now you're just a stranger  with all my secrets 
darn place i live in   the quality here is bad   hope this gets better 
the summer heat starts  will we ever be outside   losing any hope 
the sound of my heart  beating loudly like bass drums  hope you won't hear that 
i really miss you  but i will never tell you  because you moved on 
a thought is a crime  never but fascists don't care  'cos jail's bad enough 
luz de la luna  muslos blando tiemblan  beso su cuello 
the men's locker room  again my erection stirs  homosexual 
calm peaceful moments  they flicker for an instant  through the murky haze 
distant mountain peaks  disappear in the spring fog  i trust they remain 
angels light the sky  flying on forsaken wings  inciting the end 
sunny day with you  pick flowers just to crush them  everything is rouge 
golden koi shimmer  reflection of summer nights  moonlit in the pond 
at first one moment   was shared between two and now   two hearts beat as one 
from the roof i gaze  night cloud melt into the sky  i must let it go 
you asked did i hear  words spoken did we connect  my handlet us walk 
blanketed night sky  trees whisper on empty streets  out walking alone 
the bright shepherd moon  leads a flock of wispy clouds  to midnight ether 
don't break the internet   i favor it most fondly   i'm youtube famous 
left my hairtie at  ur place can i come tonight  ps i had fun 
cold comes warmth within  pain persists but tears flow heal  you are all i need 
i really miss you   like sunflowers miss the sun   on a cold dark night 
yellow flower dress  that smile high heels and a ring  your strawberry lips 
my work on display   blood and sweat nobody looks   hungry nobody cares 
sleepless night in bed  stray cat getting fucked outside  please help oh my god 
together we prayed  take the hand of your angel  love poured out for you 
maybe he likes you   maybe he doesn't like you   you will never know 
poor joe cumia  made an ass out of himself  on the people's court 
plastic and ink flows  a tool only has no life  yet shares inner worlds 
sheets of velvet rain  an existence diluted  wash away the pain 
my tarot cards said  i am destined for greatness  did they lie to me 
bonding over pearls  bonding over greg wallace  bonding over stops 
genes are the software  we have all the pieces but  dont like the picture 
stan hong kong police  you are not real patriots  hematophagy 
wind whips my body  flagellation straight from god  repentance needed 
beneath cold hard ice  another world swims with life  ice fishermen wait 
where did i come from  where did anyone come from  it must be mother 
quiet here i lay  thoughts scatter astray zooming  when will the pain go 
my new year's resolutions  so carefully planned  so soon to be broken 
procrastination  i know i have a final  why do i do this 
best cries happen here  tears and snot washing away  it's liberating 
elle est magnifique  comme la lune une nuit d'été  inaccessible 
a dog shakes for hope  traffic moves slow beneath sky  hardest section today 
a world on fire   the dark cloud spreads it's wings   no more contact 
my tennis shoes squeak  not so very annoying  mostly walk alone 
my precious cousin   only you could understand   you are sweet relief 
i saw a tiger  sucking a juicy melon  wowza what a zoo 
work sleep work again  hobbies cannot be pursued  this cycle won't end 
ambient waves beat  slow rhythms to tease the gulls  my tea is too sweet 
really quite tired  two episodes till the end  alas tomorrow 
a shift in the winds  whisp'ring of vernal colors  but only outside 
crying in the night   a child i cannot comfort   spare her heart take mine 
walking through tall grass  i squat to relieve myself  this really tickles 
the anxiety of which words  are the right words for reddit karma  the snake eats its tail 
unbenknownst to you  a friendly face cares deeply  don't disappoint them 
early winter wind  sighing through the barren trees  dark and sad farewell 
sorry no kapish  is ok i no english  we ate in silence 
put your clothes back on   and let's call this what it is   emotions stay here 
he passes the time  he pursues fruitless efforts  he blames time passing 
my friend called me wise  i believe i was just tired  cigarettes in rain 
yearning thick as tar  the mind womb for bliss and pain  days escape like breath 
a desperate strength  courage in his broken hands  hope to be born again 
liquid orange bright  lights the now clear sky purple  then comes navy night 
alliteration  even annihilation  by experimentation 
god's perfect vigil  how imperfect my vigil  lord help me this day 
frosted breath  in starlight  lover's return 
a man can find joy  with anyone so long as  he does not love her 
the f train and i  like myself it goes nowhere  and does it slowly 
oh this ritual  your desires manifest  if you are worthy 
if you have to ask  then you are prob the ass hole  spare us the stranger 
my dear fluffy friend  how i miss cuddling you  please remember me 
that shiny new purse  with babysitting money  and a ride from mom 
i would have thought that  an elephant in the room  would get talked about 
a flower remains  despite of its surroundings  admire its beauty 
sheets stick to skin  your silhouette projected  shadow puppets play 
that gem iceberg flip  carved to your married finger  it has since melted 
a fat man pounds corn  alone and angry sweating  squirrels screech on the roof 
heartbreak in my styrofoam cup   it stings the tongue   bitter like a codeine extract 
cry into the sand  tide washes away the pain  rejuvenated 
a life so lonely  a vaguely polite gesture  brings tears to your eyes 
the night fate stepped in  i was sleeping in the woods  suddenly a text 
close the fucking door  metaphoric and wooden  can you handle that 
tiny box of love  locked so it can't be stolen  but i lost the key 
never attribute  to malice that which may rise  from incompetence 
got new toilet seat  husband fitted it tonight  tomorrow a poo 
into deepest void   badly broken and battered   no light shall shine here 
beautiful morning  sierra mist awakens  sun's warming embrace 
another haiku  running out of ideas  someone please help me 
words seenlove hidden  today reveal celebrate  why not just do it 
laughing children play  so quickly the years have passed  born just yesterday 
the wind section is  conducted by the maestro  to blow in the march 
turn my bones to dust  last words clinging to the wind  my love is forever 
some of these i write  some are written by others  all of them i mean 
wisteria hangs   intersection of beauty   and foreboding doom 
bullets unto blood  the fascist origami  protest not approved 
words not said aloud  but felt from a world away  words not yet allowed 
under open doors  something about forgetting  tethered to new sights 
your love shifts my plans  how perfect your care for me  our faith unites us 
understandably  i rise to work in morning  but hesitantly 
broke it in millions   shinto gets all together   kintsugi brings life 
to take a breath  what it is to be in awe  cherish all ere death 
a punishing man  a stranger inside our home  he calls himself dad 
slight chill in the air  fall always brings thoughts of you  come and keep me warm 
fire season returns  evacuation orders  be safe california 
the smell of coffee  soothes the soul of this poor boy  the moon knew and smiled 
maturity found    spring cleaning in mind and soul    needed last winter 
gentle rain breezes  cools the day and warms my heart  carried into dreams 
the buds of tulip  glows under the bright gaze of  the morning sunlight 
the past is dying  space is being created  now fill it with joy 
i feel so sadly   i want to tell him badly   i love him madly 
your perfect love  for me for all alleluia  thank you lord 
contemplative strain  inspiration as i push  then i flush it down 
you can beat a dead   horse to water but you can't   look it in the mouth 
evil is my choice  tight rope down the left hand path  saturnalia 
today at the pond  a duck held its breath quite long  i counted thirty 
what a happy place  that treehouse cabin was great  bed breakfast and bark 
thought about death today  gave me strength for tomorrow  my time begins now 
they seem so surprised  every time their unleashed dogs  attack somebody 
a dream to believe  i can never let go now  fantasy is real 
black light scorpion  shining at the end of fall  in both dirt and sky 
snow held in pine trees   sun makes them give up their hold   shimmering on distant hills 
let this rain cleanse me   put out the fire within   a new day will dawn 
how many christians  do you bring to satan's house  orgy and snacks 
flicker of the light  trembling swarms from interactions  physics interests me 
threads torn dark holes form  connection lost all lights off  decaying remains 
you killed them all dead  you just downright blew their minds  encore mi amore 
bacon on my plate  hell yeah to cholesterol  crispy perfection 
dark of night undone  lightning scars a velvet sky  i wait for the sound 
once again you asked  once again yes my answer  once again such love 
stiff fluctuations  blazing like a granite sun  in polarised hearts 
cane toad under my wheels  sympathy for the devil  they hurt my tree frogs 
the rays run across  just a thousand miles of  perpetual dark 
little cuckoo calls  clear sound air feeling lovely  this day is quiet 
your eyes dance with mine  our bodies do the tango  we bow to applause 
is being in love  the surest way that one day  you'll hate each other 
music softly floats  subduing utter silence  i drift off to sleep 
dropped spear rusted shield  hollow eyes in a bronze face  time was the true foe 
a wet nor'easter  the urge to move from this couch  fueled by my bills 
i do not know why  that we lie to each other  i'm so confused 
we make so much trash  our bins need wheels to move them  to the curb each week 
the flies are buzzing  simpletons looking for light  the moon miles away 
the moonlight delights  fairy's dancing within beams  peacefully happy 
horror read in braille  something sinister coming  i can just feel it 
the scene has been set  a playlist of sad memories  a third glass of wine 
young sprout filled with hope  yearns for sun bends to forces  poor deformed bonsai 
a memory made  this moment frozen in time  mine forever more 
i did eat a bug  why did i do it oh no  crap im poisoned help 
thoughts of death appear  tears reflect the screen's soft glow  free winrar expired 
all of us will grow  older and wiser wishing  never to grow up 
empowered by grace  my love poured out for you dear  glory praise to god 
hooray sung the king  although he'd forgot the words  so it was silence 
a bomb fell with grace   glides through the air peacefully   looking for it's place 
empty crinkled bag  fingertips hold the magic  yummy cheeto dust 
your eyes looked through mine  i felt like i was home then  i woke from my dream 
i pretend to sleep  as she sneaks out of my room  never looking back 
the door is open  you are as free as the wind  if not louder than 
it's stunning to think   how better off i would be   had we never met 
an unexpected  muscle was used today i  will not forget you 
rain colliding now  into my window softly  a beautiful song 
silky smoke rises  from the deep urn of wisdom  my dreams come to life 
a love once burned bright  now dwindles without a light  how do i reignite 
prime numbers  haiku  same 
waters darkly gleam  and sirens in the moonlight  fleeting as a dream 
turn off all the noise  violence is not the answer  follow your true north 
lungs fill with fresh air  snails crawl on the morning grass  where i want to be 
both are wrapped for cold  kids provided robes for their  angel in the snow 
all day i refresh  that damn tracking history  where is my package 
mud grazes the trees  brown leaves crushed beneath me  the path becomes clear 
sun past its highest  consciousness returns to me  scrolling commences 
oh you do not care  just sit around do nothing  mister panda bear 
so many words  choosing one at a time  most will stay noiseless 
happened long ago   happened not so long ago   don't ever look back 
oh my such gossip  told by my black umbrella  chatting with the rain 
good conversation   good tunes too just one question   who the hell are you 
a rainy deep dark night  beautiful as ever it helps  the broken heart mends 
tornado growls  trampoline disappears  tree stands firm 
you cannot escape   truth is penetrating all   struggle is futile 
before you ramble  if you can't read my silence  then you are nothing 
drowning in dharma   a raft making itself known   why bother grasping 
life is just talking  in between depression naps  i hurt constantly 
lone tree old but strong  lightning struck mercilessly  in flames still standing 
why do i deceive  those that want the best for me  will i ever change  
it is so damn cold  my hood is cute but useless  ears are icicles 
feel like such a waste  potential never fulfilled  will things turn around 
a dream about you  somehow leaves me emptier  quickly fades away 
a glistening leaf  too soon felled by autumn storms  leaves bitter misfortunes 
endlessly drifting  a leaf in the clear river  forever afloat 
netflix the couch my  pup pjs a blanket and  wine cant forget wine 
there was no glimmer  or sparkle on her anklet  except surveillance 
clicks of the pipette  many hundreds and a smell  of bacteria 
dear jon of eden  if words healed broke bodies  you'd be a doctor 
your love makes me itch  others may touch the same skin  no one else can scratch 
amber waves of grain  gentle rustle from kind breeze  the meadows harp sings 
darkening mornings  summer's humid air lingers  a gentle dispute 
the great migration   south   men can only dream 
dirt under my feet   worms cry out in my tired hands   another grave robbed 
society is   three days of toilet paper   away from chaos 
the tortoise wanders  as silent as its shadow  under the noon sun 
unfolding paper  to find the bones of the swan  hidden in creases 
captivates my soul  shatters my heart every time   mindful of my strength 
the fifth brightest star   in a constellation shines   with just enough light 
there is no more love  you don't talk and shut me out  she was my kid too 
crispy crackling  that pleasant smell wafts by  lightning and thunder 
raindrops are quite wet  they often fall from the sky  now my car is clean 
divert confuse blind  not the way i want to walk  a constant battle 
what is my purpose  to love and serve as he does  following the lamb 
today i get cake  found out the date by mistake  haiku best i've got 
paper mache wings  and origami flowers  nature's craft unfolds 
i need your help now  you say wait till tomorrow  i say fuck waiting 
current government  privatizing profit and  socializing debt 
no more excuses  they get in the way of goals  get up and do it 
surrounded by art  i feel uncomfortable  how do i create 
through deepest black  dimly moonlit snow  outlines the branches 
natural beauty  the celebration of life  a blessing of spring 
reliving my past  hello from purgatory  how do i let go 
easy to carry  reunite nature and mind  haiku therapy 
your value resides  in the ruler you create  not someone else's 
a day of parting  temporary it may be  i'll miss you tonight 
mow the lawn again  no i don't think i will dude  i'll just go riding 
heart break love story  comedy or tragedy  funny tale ending 
a forge  the hissing snake  returns 
stillness then a tap  its struggle begins and ends  a family fed 
walk in through the door   receptionist and doctor   woman cries on bed 
tires hiss in the rain  downturned faces walking home  together alone 
two weeks to winter  next spring's deepest dark secrets  already buried 
kindness for weakness  afflictions you prey upon  will come to it's end 
the wind and the tree  dance and sing all through the night  morning brings silence 
hither rests my wish  followed by a rising tinge  a looming shadow 
young man's dream to fly   perched into a woman's eye   too nervous to jump 
my heart it beats true  love for the ocean at night  turtles are the best 
i picture her face  the thought of her soft smile  but that's all she is 
london neighborhoods  fog enveloping the town  intimate mornings 
nagged for his smoking  but slothfulness is squeezing  heaven's narrow gate 
free joe exotic   tiger king of quarentine  fuck carole baskin 
illuminating  the dark space between the stars  the silver moon sails 
the wingsuit man jumps  how shameful we are to watch  a life completed 
calm upon the lake  hands breathe fire in the air  coupled as one 
sitting on a hill   you see the world below you   your life is locked down 
the old gray squirrel  has seen another winter  twitchy little beast 
born into the light  just to face the gloomy truth  the world is wicked 
quickly as you can  snatch the pebble from my hand  said old master kan 
dark ocean starlight   ripples warp the glowing points   i can taste the salt 
it's true we all lie  i will counterfeit myself  false identity 
i love you always  whether you listen or not  oh toddler of mine 
all my lonely roads  followed at my lonley times  lead straight back to you 
my mind is closing  my soul is eating alive  cherished memory 
i hear my heart beat  it scares me that it might stop  inhale hold it out 
the numerator  this bar stands for division  denominator 
would i die for her  would i drop it all for her  then why didn't i 
one's hypocrisy   is another's redemption   growth is personal 
talk myself into circles  shove away anyone close  me oh me oh me 
fighting mental health  the trauma of facing death  the diarrhea 
tokyo pluto  limit of astrovision  are spaceships waiting 
foundation shaking  running through the mists again  depressed labyrinth 
no acupuncture  doesn't belong in my heart  your needles hurt me 
within this whirlwind  of emotions you saw me  your embrace soothes storms 
winter approaches  the seeds of life remain still  patiently waiting 
condense the moment  extract the essence of life  the key to haiku 
i try to sleep but  i'm caught in this interweb  the glow of my sloth 
leaves fall days shorten  old elm branches interlaced  walking arm in arm 
a country in two  should not be bound by party  but by common good 
a quiet moment  sitting in bed before sleep  really listening 
glistening slight pink  dripping thinking about kink  push in easy sink

sleep is coming fast  i lay tired yet awake  soon only darkness 
melted chocolate  sound of the television  home is for healing 
woman in my dreams   i awake to the nightmare   why can't you be real 
daily joy for dogs  muzzle pinching choke collars  and dragged by a bike 
i have a puppy   roach is not housebroken yet   he's pissing again 
reading in the grass  the load of laundry blows by  we have no clothespins 
blue skies are leading  but grey clouds are passing and  took hold of the rains 
do i wish i could  or is mediocrity  my shoot for the stars 
the depth of winter  darkest coldest time of year  may it pass quickly 
a mountain of pride  i fall to the begging  a revine of hope 
if you come inside  you will know all that's within  so don't pull out now 
'a pig or a dog'  my though on first seeing you  now your snores mean home

looking important  the crane returns every day  he needs a top hat 
ashes and embers  ghosts of trees that warmed my bones  the hills are bare now 
dove floating on wind  with grace elegance and peace  nope just a napkin 
my chest is hurting  this happens everytime  i mix those two drugs 
how can one person  think they exist but solely  for their own pleasure 
when you took your life  you took part of my life too  oh how i hate you 
once a roaring flame  now only heat as coals glow  what of tomorrow 
an old tarnished key  sits on the emptied house steps  but yet you still knock 
slow steady breathing  there is someone beside me  no more lonely nights

food on the table  each and every meal time  we celebrate death 
at the break of dawn  dew drops slide slowly on grass  the land awakens 
friends taken too soon  the world is worse without them  ah but life goes on 
mellow rimmed with salt  people bustle all around  waves against my shore 
i count syllables  and recount when they are wrong  i hope you do the same 
that place is outside  we huddled under a quilt  ignore it and kiss 
i still remember  how we kissed passionately  but where are you now

thinning autumn trees   reveal the neighbor's houses  smile and wave 
coyote sunset  sky goes from purple to pink  mesa silhouettes 
seagulls are soaring  unseen currents overhead  cries of freedom found 
there is a silence  stillness underneath the noise  aware of itself 
the flock flies aimless  squawking squabbling clawing air  circling terrified 
wonder if i've met  something special in your texts  love in infancy

from sea to blue sea  not a single soul but me  sees beyond the sea 
ok i replied  receiving the lie you told  i love you too babe 
a s m r eh  tingle and mingle my brain  better than cocaine 
from what great away  has this rain drop come today  to land on my cheek 
gray skies in the east  watching them is not enough  i have things to do 
bits of poetry  crumpled and folded in my  pocket forgotten 
snow ice blocks the path  even great glaciers melt  patience that's the key 
eyes are on the prize  focus is unrelenting  today is the day 
what if the world sees   it will judge how i can be   what if it loves me 
white noise where your name  once was space where your shoes lived  lonely coffee mug 
i wish i was not  always so loney while  standing in a crowd 
fangs behind the smile  liked my neck and was thirsty  asked to come inside 
life is a play  we're all actors  who's watching us 
a chance to explain  my poorly guessed intentions  misunderstanding 
i had my own life  until you showed up in it  now i want to share 
greens and browns vanish  orange and yellow dominate  sunset paints the hills 
hidden day owls hoot  an old man told me of you  unexpected joy 
i like how you taste  i'm going to savour this  until i regret 
my life is haiku  just five seven and five things   and it is haiku 
skies paved in concrete  while tail lights paint the snow red  geese take the fast lane 
literally took  the words right out of my mouth  give them back you thief 
i will feel better  some day i will feel better  for now this is fine 
sit along edges  pressed against my beds corners  a pure restlessness 
what i did not think  haikus would be hart to write  i was wrong 
never understood  i never tried to either  head buried in mud 
too bad i cannot   post pictures to truly show   meaning beyond words 
you asked to help me  i refusedsoon i was lost  will i ever learn 
ants on the table  dirty laundry on the floor  i need to clean up 
i dont even know   why i keep playing this game   i lost long ago 
do you exist god  why did mom not miscarry  every single time 
the extent of breath  energy flows throughout me  the balance restored 
a dark night closes  and as i open my eyes  bugs sing good morning 
drab autumn clouds hang  low mourning summer's end  leaves blaze like sun 
entered through again  a closed window  the leaf smile 
a beautiful day  shivering despite the sun  cold as loneliness 
my platealways full  called to love and servealways  i do it for you 
love burning within  for you now and always  come let's celebrate 
hands thoroughly washed  i rub my cracked knuckles dry  aaaand i have to pee 
i wait by the phone   for every text can be the last   when will you leave me 
i should be working  on my homework due tonight  but i'd rather not 
singing songs of love  i sit by the river bank  waiting for a boat 
night turns to morning  reason and logic long gone  damn this lizard brain 
rain on the windows  takeout chopsticks and the couch  late night paradise 
a chorus of frogs  are peeping out spring notes in  a soprano bog 
our lives are a mystery   shine a light on my purpose   just along for fun 
loneliness each day  love and comfort found in faith  rough this pilgrimage 
don't need to be saved  i only ever needed  to be understood 
ageing is funny   we find new ways to fuck up   as we go along 
the bed depresses  is it the mattress or me  either way i sink 
it went the wrong way  the water chose for my lungs  i started coughing 
rain rages  lilies bow  casket sinks 
terrible button  release a cockroach's lips  to chuckle again 
it's like a nicked vein  bleeding unable to stop  iron mixed with salt 
there are only six   you heard me six taco bells   in all of japan 
sun on my shoulders  a walk with mother nature  fresh air clears the mind 
master he could be  using the force to groove with  if yoda played the bass 
grievance good given   a higher posed hidden light   or a sense of space 
a forlorn switch of  twilight in the cawing of  daylight savings crows 
a disconnection  a block of time that is gone  will i ever know 
your words like daggers  wielded with such precision  invisible wounds 
bleeding though uncut  internal wounds never healed  now i love the pain 
rain water needed   but sometimes it ruins crops   the good somewhere stops 
when i walk with you  i want to fall into you  and touch all of you 
humble spring unfolds  the fair little tree hangs on  tiny mountain walls 
who are you really  hiding behind a smile  it's a facade 
art confined to dust  no capacity for change  death of the haiku 
anthony bourdain  ultimately lost the fight  what chance do i have 
dastardly mud patch  you took me on the way out  i gave returning 
i should feel fainter   surely i've lost enough blood   this hole in my heart 
tell me your burden   i will toss mine to the ground   to help carry yours 
the wintry flecks were  collected into heaps from  their scissor snowflakes 
small blue bits gray clouds  long lost dreams gone sand grains fall  three more shots today 
just two waves joining  crashing chaotic ocean  then peaceful once more 
secluded alone  humanities meaning lost  i have become death 
we turn from the sun  and the trees withdraw their sap  small lives are ending 
open honest fresh  love filled each moment with you  again is my hope 
not today they said    a difficult conversation    nothing left to say 
stoic standing firm  while seasons change around him  the evergreen tree 
poor effort you say   the rules don't apply to me   the haiku rebel 
southeast and northwest   never shall they meet they say   we defied the rules 
i smoke weed daily   puff puff pass it is so dank   oh shit my pipe broke 
after three days off   back at work virtually   dressed from the waist up 
no wind for the sail  all the world yet to be had  birds have all the luck 
the daily drive home  a scenic and gorgeous view  lush valleys and hills 
the second hand is   the third hand the second hand  is the minute hand 
but you'd be surprised  the epiphanies you'd find  in another's life 
i'm just waiting here  you promised me forever  now i am alone 
if the good die young  then why am i still alive  is it 'cause i'm bad 
here is a haiku  that i wrote this afternoon  about a haiku 
no clear path ahead  take control with quarantine  ensure your wellbeing 
friday to let loose  saturday to recover  sunday to repent 
remorseful angels  a hummingbird the bottle  on my knees softer 
gilding a goldfinch  perched within a budding tree  he unties her scarf 
never are things perfect  imperfections like spring leaves  love every day 
dreams are so vapid  when both your eyes are closed  all you see is me 
i wish i cared less  i wish that i could forget   erase my sadness 
somewhere over the  rainbow way up high there's a  land that i heard of  
i come home and see  house become menagerie  five roommate monkies 
future approaching  who to be what to seek out  i only want peace 
a plane in the sky  gone with nothing left behind  is everyone lost 
the fight that broke us  in bed we lay quietly  her hand grabs for mine 
are you serious  i'm not somebody you know  obvious red flags 
huddle cuddle dance  from my heart flows rhythm to  symbiotic friends

this pitiless ice   breaks my ass like a tea cup  every fucking year 
it took me too long   to notice i wrote haiku   for the wrong person 
upside down street sign  dangling from a rusty bolt  reflecting high beams 
the boy runs  the girl studies  death is upon us 
have a toke stick man  empty my rack take a chance  cold bones to the wind 
a flock of starlings  in mindblowing formations  birds can be awesome 
always in my mind  i wrote about you today  my love symphony 
the lonely ostrich  sits atop yellow mountain  and waits for ice cream 
the edge of the wedge  the gilt on the things we have built  how sound is the ground 
got into trouble  somehow made it out alive  rebels never die 
fields of red poppies  lives cut down and strewn around  lest we forget them 
octavio paz   i silently start to read   my soul seeks some peace 
to say i like you   discourse so complicated   humans interact 
when the water swims  up the river towards source  the fish understands 
the roar of the falls  and time spent falling asleep  what it takes to jump 
summer's almost here  robins fly north seems like it  never went away 
i yearn to be brave   fear drowns me and takes over   breathe and try again 
the environment cries   overindustrialize  oh what have we done 
peacefully i go  drowned in a sea of faces  lungs filled with small talk

unfathomable  her love is for her children  gift of god indeed 
crossing open sea  sailing with a strong night wind  guided by the stars 
a man in his car  complains about the traffic  to which he belongs 
our thoughts and prayers  then we will just go along  like nothing happened 
i want to be good   for whatever that is worth   i love everyone 
perfectly colored   manicured nails blue and red  dressed for the party 
good taste in humor  something i need to learn still  my jokes are selfish 
a truth like water  flows through cracks in your story  discovers its shape 
roses from the grove  in the kitchen they wait for  the breeze the silence 
endless asphalt grows  dissociate dissolve  no destination 
haikus are easy  writing them sensibly is  very hard colander 
i change my colors  just like a chameleon  always unhappy 
a building pressure  an ecstasy unrivalled  the turd releases 
compartmentalize  all the aspects of our lives  without knowing why 
early morning rain  dewdrops on leaves  spiders wear tiny raincoats 
grating dulcet tones  i hope that ambient noise  fucking destroys you 
building a ladder  rungs upon rungs lace two stalks  climbing and growing 
you mean to tell me  this could have been an email  and no one brought snacks 
zuck takes out his suit  and sits before congress while  our privacy sells 
reinvented through calamity  i trust you more now  i trust myself 
vengeance takes a steed  holy fires seize their season  and nature recedes 
a silver cup held  a chalice of stars for the  offering by moon 
my scars have opened  old marks are bleeding anew  burn with memories 
plutonian seoul  hubble could barely see it  kuiper ships waiting 
each moment treasured  stokes the flames of love within  such warmth for each day 
this has me thinking  can all the haiku's be summed  with mathematics 
the long winter melt  awakens desert flora  like a cold shower 
past a reflection   of what future can become   do we dare look back 
a teasing solstice  unveiling her limbs with the  leaves fluttering off 
haikus are like drugs  once you start you cannot stop  somebody help me 
your breath on my neck  our lungs ablaze now i'm on  a ventilator 
gazing at the sky  stuck dreaming of tomorrow  motionless today 
knock knock who is there  a jester looking for laughs  merriment for all 
let me seek some rest  this is endless exhaustion   there has to be help 
adrift in the sea  fish overhead like rockets  calm inside the storm 
someone comforting  wrapped in your arms and your love  there i feel at home 
it has been a year  guess we are not meant to be  shit i still love you 
need to catch my breath  this is drowning me too deep  have to get out now 
visage of the flame  recalls the day of our lives  like smoke in the wind 
today at the pond  a duck held its breath quite long  counted twenty eight 
faceless laughs online   i hope her gaze in the flesh  does not break the spell 
is he made of house  or is the house made of flesh  not knowing he screams 
dear jon of eden  if words healed broken bodies  you'd be a doctor 
still doesn't make sense  vague ass smatterings of words  sit with me and talk 
is it a mirror  your eyes are gazing into  or is it the void 
a cloudy meltdown  with a watermark moon in  a puddling of stars 
i long for the warmth  of a forgotten embrace  i miss you my love 
you are the crashing  of the ocean waves and the  smell of salty air 
i hope me meet thrice   each couple greater than last   fairytale nightmare 
hastly lifting feet  pavement baked by day breathing  the taste of sunblock 
babbling water  tiny crashes of droplets  shiny pebbles watch 
in my heart's dungeon  through the bars of my rib cage  i held a heart beat 
you were a mistake  before i even made you  i can't fix you now 
why is it god that  our very lives we must steal  teeth sever tissue 
sod requires water  this summer has been so dry  new yard's in peril 
so very tired   will my thoughts please let me rest   sleep take me away 
when you betrayed me  i was blinded by my own faults  just a boy now lost 
a tree will live through  millions of years to see that  man is arrogant 
our reality  a persistent illusion  shattered innocence 
everyday i am  wading through frigid butter  only you can melt 
man yields prejudice  violence breeds violence  eden sank to grief 
as you grow older   you get better they said   they probably meant bitter 
blades of grass flutter  violently in the wind  but still their roots hold 
do you believe that  our short but sweet love story  contains the word again 
two bodies in bed  a brief contact in the dark  mosquito and i 
my energy spent  i slip into exhaustion  please let me have rest 
darting back to bed   your warm body against mine   just five more minutes 
good morning bonsai  time for a haircut just a  little off the top 
low rumbles within  growing louder sweating now  where's the toilet please 
i breathe and gasp drenched  with earthy scents i must pause  for monsoon is here 
golden hydrangea  petals catch light a fine sail  among singing birds 
this is not a phase   the future here is so bleak   my heart now is black

deep wheeze i breathe in  cough and cough to no avail  for i am the phlegm 
back in the office   desk plant survived without me   life will find a way 
the tone of the wind   shaping the voice of the rain  how luxurious 
the echoes of screams   passing winds and waving trees   the mind is at peace 
pow the champagne flows  an outburst of emotions  bubbles mix with blood 
for i am now banned  no longer shall i subscribe  askreddit goodbye 
the world is falling  everything crumbling near me  yet i laugh it off 
the most precious gem  is unearthed from a mother  instead of the dirt 
kids think they know more   now they see less but know more   their youth is no more 
soft intermittent   light flickers between petals   cleansing troubled mind 
with no umbrella  we ran the rest of the way  such a smelly dog 
tornado weather  when standing corn waves goodbye  my red october 
wind whips through my soul  snows howl and blow in hatred  it's too freaking cold 
sand beneath my feet  sun gazing over the sea  now summer is here 
warm sunshine cold breeze  visible signshidden love  smiles reveal the source

the hope that you lit  illuminated my world  if only briefly 
two ducks glide across  turtle pond their wake trails merge  together as one 
i told her my dreams  she told me i was selfish  i'm devastated 
warmth flows around me  cold bitterness flows inside  i love shower beer 
time used for thinking  should not be seen as empty  thought becomes action 
sundown the trees bleed  the view from behind haunts me  yet keeps me enticed 
nice amount of snow   vacant backyard jungle gym  february sky 
quiet and falling  the reflection isn't me  confronting myself 
no one really dies  guess we were never alive  just dead memories 
i may get the job  they called for an interview  i need all your prayers 
my heart it cries out  please just call me your darling  so i can feel loved

a little closer  be a little quieter  the gentlest touch 
butterfly bounced  across the field in front of  net and running boy 
crude truths silky lies  we each have a favourite  and one we despise 
there is a ladder  this ladder has no ending  why not stop climbing 
took a little stroll  to the corners of my mind  found my dusty self 
this summer morning  cutting through a thousand trees  the screech from a hawk 
they fell deep in love  under the full moon one night  after their first kiss 
a summer cooler  abruptly awakened for  their winter fortress 
soft breeze filled the air  melancholic mood sets in  it started to rain 
fresh air and sunshine  a relaxed morning with friends  breakfast with the birds 
coffee and cigar  cool breeze blows birds chirp bees buzz  summer vacation 
a fresh first sweet sip  cleans my messy morning mind  oolong gong fu cha 
like a glass window  shattering in response to  a brick thrown through it 
i try to grasp you  i pull yet you slip away   damn stupid nose hair 
oh how wonderful  the path beneath the tree tops  while the spring rain talks 
a sweet godly sun  fresh as my skin when i wake up  why remove my post 
your way before me  how i need help to walk it  each step forward please 
temple bells die out  the fragrant blossoms remain  a perfect evening 
hearts beat together  closer with each new second  train over green fields 
in the trees on snow  standing still silent eyes glisten  in my ears too soft 
when women tell you  chivalry is dead just say  those are some nice tits 
i am ecstatic  the twilight force have returned  life has meaning now 
life begins in spark   leaves an ever fleeting mark   to end lulled in dark 
waning gibbous moon  i reflect upon my age  and the paths i took 
your pain my prayers  trusting god's love care for you  here for you my love 
heard the call of the  geese by the twinkling of the  light of orion

whoa is what i said  booty an amazing view  while she gives me head 
lost numb gelid blood  god pours holy kerosene  warmth seized her that night 
sharp eyes spot movement  salmon glisten shallow stream  is their future safe 
cleaning up my room  memories from a stranger  that i once was 
her hair as curtain  was draping a profile in  the feminine blush 
i can't remember   the days when you cared for me  i miss your embrace 
relief starts to come  paid in tears and words with friends  hope begins again 
growing before you  has been awkward and painful  i might be done soon 
spinning a blue cloud  in cotton candy fluff to  delight paper cones 
little winter birds  chattering amongst themselves  outside my window 
remembering love expressed  unbreakable eternal is our bond  tears of joy 
isolated here   far grime family and friends   abuser is smart 
long years my colleague  a part of every word  molar for the tongs 
if the planet earth  was one big cultural site  would there be no war 
all the bees and trees  won't lament even briefly  human extinction 
my candle has died  the dull slow burning incense  is all i have left 
maybe we have clenched  our fists enough to hurt but  alas we endured 
the angel's cold tears  call for the land's protector  but no one answers 
in the open fields  the blind scarecrow keeps close watch  standing not in vain 
cold use your pockets  but daddy they're full with what  fast cars and mittens 
unlocking the doors  a thief had stolen in and  stolen paradise 
fingers of fog  stealing leaves from the trees  who cries an owl 
painting your portrait  i gyrate my hips and howl  canvas remains blank 
alien i am  anunnaki deity  won't they abduct me 
silohette stranger  i see but only one side  my deadly figure 
a salty winter  forecasting a salty spring  sweating off the snacks 
i longing for guests  sit patiently anxious  sweating my remaining hope 
frozen travelers  welcome a warm companion  no cream or sugar 
half rest conversion  a voice in mother of pearl  wind chest without ribs 
cat pounces   on nothing particular   simple life 
reaching for the sun  but only grabbing sunlight  nice try icarus 
i cut my own hair  reporting for duty sir   too damn short again

deforming trees with  pitiful when gardeners  mount the goofy face 
i like most women  plump sweet and begging for cream  thank you very much 
her eyes are wet coins  too many they're drowning me  i hope she leaves soon 
twisted thorn branches   loom over my desert seat   my puddle of shade 
the burden of life  thrusted upon all who's born  to live or not to 
mind fog heart racing  anxious not aware of cause  altered dosage woes 
at nudist campsite  forgot sleeping bag and tent  made some friends that night 
she's ash in the ground  s joy sadness pain memories  s buried alone now 
pain as my pleasure  cold hard steel thrust to my heart  the final climax 
she screamed out oh god  i know she's an atheist  she must not hate this 
oh how we do choke   on the words which we wish we   had never spoken 
you cry for the storm  you cringe and curse the thunder  yet you run outside 
bulldozed skyscraper  hard hats and fat grey pigeons  linger in the sun 
i'm not listening  i screamed jumping in the pool  just drowning you out 
each wave casts shadows   onto the next repeating   us from memory 
a hushed droning din  distant keys clack and phones ring  a belly rumbles 
veils of moss  drape the stones in shades  overgrown 
i claw my chest out  inside i hope to find her  but just a dead bird 
fuck you  oceans and mountains and shit  fuck you 
i'm sad it's ending  i mourn i dread i'm weeping  tasks never ending 
it feels so hopeless  they don't believe i can fly  i will prove them wrong 
candy canes are good   candy canes can be sharpened  use it as a shank

mental health is a  solitary prison cell  or a bubble popped 
leaves fall upon earth  man sweeps away these ugly bits  no one blames the tree 
imagined roadblock  addressed quickly cleared sunshine  take my hand let's walk 
struggling through thick drifts  cold snow suddenly covered  in cherry blossoms 
closed curtains small bed  browsing subreddits all night  a brand new cake day 
enduring the pain  of the needle stabbing her  for beauty not seen 
a flower of love  stretching toward the sunlight  held fast by its roots 
one billion flashlights  shine down from the winter sky  over sleeping tents 
in each moment you  then i see you more clearly  perfect is your love

yet you still smoulder  an untamed blaze for all souls  gifted mystery 
unbroken water  frog hasn't jumped to old pond  sound of stare out eyes 
breathe in hold breathe out  feel the air enter your soul  repeat until calm 
my chest is still warm  from the last hug you gave me  my eternal spring 
cut my veins and feed  drink the red blood of my soul  poetry you vampire 
i wrote this poem  the gatekeeper frowns delete  smug satisfaction 
summer cheeks flushed red   his flesh that of a stone fruit   full i consume thee 
my cat weighed two stone  yet the hummingbirds still know  the branches she reached 
how can such beauty  become simply forgotten  a thing of the past 
bare feet in a field  ouch a spiky prickly plant  how well we have it 
alone as always  only my tears touch the ground  as life fades away 
eighteen years have passed  sharp blue sky with no contrails  a deep sad autumn 
most sleep with the sun   but me and my love luna   we stargaze all night 
you look like art when  you smile in my direction  priceless beautiful 
old wooden gate slams  startled a young crow takes flight  wakes me from a thought

bird of paradise  my nest was not enough but  you left a feather 
just watched the oscars  no one was running the show  much like the white house 
floating slowing down   falling drifting deeper now   sleep and rest your crown 
whisper of roses   the winds carried it to her   hands hide her red checks 
they're talking to me  but they don't say any words  they speak in colours 
slanted golden rays  light birdsong and reverie  at dawn poet's day 
ground dark roasted beans  wafting aroma caffeine  a cup steaming hot 
skimming stones on rain  falling brief as phases go  faint traces of puddles 
i wait for your end  grey february long march  andale vite 
laughing spirits high  reconnecting old lost friends  with dry wood crackling 
i will always be  your house plant stuck and waiting  for you to come home 
yonder is our star  dimming fading in the sky  why are you so far 
teleworking day   spent an hour explaining zoom   to older colleagues 
diesel truck running  birds chirping to greet march  pull blankets higher 
the wiggles were right  fruit salad yummy yummy  best part of summer 
doggo says hello  i want to boop that sniffer  and tickle those ears 
canes at the ready  the old men argue a point  same place every day 
glory unstrapped freed  big wiggling jigglers  to motorboat squeeze 
we don't talk about  our childhood we just express  the habit of fear 
a red rose rises   out of the thick milky black   bathed by your shadow 
net neutrality  we will miss so much that thing   fuck you ajat pai 
my laundry pocket  held september's note when the  acorn had dropped in 
you carry the scent   of every man that made you   an ancient love spell 
carry me to depths  but let me not dwell in them  i still want to hope 
it bitterly aches  to love somebody that hates  someone that you love 
they claimed it was hard  i watched it destroy their grades  i have no regrets 
up in the far sky  the big star is shining bright  i think i miss you 
always do your best  won or lost follow the way  lessons learned repeat 
mixing a drink with  holy water unabsolved  the sins that follow 
salt flowers bloom  on dessert lake without color  high sun no shadows

did we connect friend  love exchanged but joy escaped  hope carries us forth 
was it all a dream  i most certainly hope not  that was happiness 
i was in half sleep  flash glimpse of light manifest  arm sleeve strange device 
all eyes diverted  to a turquoise bikini  shifting on the sand 
vomit stench wet sheets   happy bath all better now   false hope still real sick 
anxiety  tight throat crushing my dreams  cool flow bring me back to life 
as summer ends  the shades project their shadows  warmth is comforting 
the nurse nurtures wounds  spy collects reconnaissance  hunter stalks his prey 
why even bother   when time runs so slowly   to rush through your life

a piece of her soul  slid off her shoulder today  no one bat an eye 
the trade winds whispers   making the leaves and trees dance   breathing life to them 
smiles with family   only makes me feel bitter   where were you before 
some people like to  create their own storms then get  upset when it rains 
it's been some time friend  should i call you that let me  introduce myself

driftwood upon stone  like a fist raised in the sky  opaline eyes blink 
you live in a land  i am forced to abandon  when my eyes open 
my profile page  to see if i am online  will turn green to gray 
dark windy restless cold  rain hitting from all angles  the sky full of rage 
real or illusion  what happens to a moment  changed by memory 
the moon a phantom  orange shifting wavering  swimming in brandy 
staring at the wall  my melatonin working  sleep is approaching 
do you remember  good times bad times love we shared  bonds of love renewed 
is spring not just an   awakening of the earth   from near lethal dream 
what a long way down  i am tired of the climb  tell my friends goodbye 
eyes open wide awake  search for phone what time is it  oh my god my eyes 
water flows cascades  rocks tower in shade and light  drama yet tranquil 
moonbeams flood the room  sleepless nights are nothing new  be bravekeep going 
a quiet river   salmon jump up waterfalls   a bear gets a snack 
the accusing eyes  in taxidermy mounts are  glaring at the guns 
which face will i wear  and what truths will i tell you  i don't know myself 
my toes curl up tight   gripping ancient tree branches   when your seed is sown 
the sky is still dark  don't wake me up so early  going back to sleep 
a summer cooler  pitched in to pack the blocks for  a winter fortress 
mosquitoes buzz near  sticky red strawberry hands  swift sting of sweetness 
early summer rain  the lonely horror of life  mud pours in the street 
she's gone from this world  a goodbye still on her lips  i love you on mine 
we had some good years  then our paths sadly diverged  i want to move on 
i want to go back  i liked my self way better  back back in the past

cybernauts slumber   digital dreams so serene   lost in neon glow 
innocence incensed  teachers parents and preachers  all they say is nice 
depression hits hard  i struggle with living well  one day at a time 
to be immortal  cryogenically frozen  i awake in space 
yes i am in love  there i said it i love you  i love you goodbye 
a forest of trees  for the nazarene have been  sprouting up in lots 
the lungs of the earth  lay motionless and silent  in a box outside 
soft and warm and light  you curl near my body purring  this will last forever 
the clickety shoes  had men stealing glances at  their disappointment 
starving baby bird  nobody will come for you  choose your end and fly 
awoke at midnight  thunder banging at my door  zeus is drunk again 
my soulmate is out  there somewhere pushing a pull  door i just know it 
the clock correct twice  the hallway deprived of light  repair at bell tell 
i am allowed privs  a monitored desktop job  no deodorant 
self conscious morning  a little joe little jane  breakfast sausages 
it was the night time  a welder in the train yard  all the sparks flying 
i see trees of green  red roses too i see them  bloom for me and you 
username sunset  then over the horizon  throwaway account 
it was just a kiss   but i've planned out our wedding   and how you'll leave me 
unless you know me  i appear to you my friend  a contradiction 
gone in an instant   i know i'll still think of you   tears fall knowing truth 
a pure fiery spirit lies  at the back of my little eyes  not all could sense it 
why does every  grocery store manager  choose to wear a vest 
made by milkweed for  the king of caterpillars  the monarch muffler 
i fucked your mother   ha ha i'm so original   ur mum gei no u 
it is sad but true  that bitter experience  makes great poetry 
two of three lines done  poetic constipation  finishing is hard 
crush them crush them all  until they turn to diamonds  pure unyielding clear 
savor your time here  for it will deplete quickly  live without regrets 
and it was his eyes  that got me like a car crash  mirror image flashblacks 
i walk through the past  the streets are filled with color  somehow they're still dull 
do not even try   to make me go there outside   i am having class 
serene and calming   a cooling breeze brings relief   this hot summer day 
next to the fig tree  before the shimmering lake  lies the house of love 
the clock keeps turning  i made it another year  i'm disappointed 
woke up with a kiss  just to find i was alone  affection rehab 
as i grow older  the child in me slips away  i fight to hold on 
this life that you lead  and this breath that you leave  is one within me 
i saw you with him  this time i'm not jealous  but i am leaving 
words we expressed  ideas exchanged did we connect  our paths affected 
absolute conscience  experiencing itself  we are all witness 
urgent nighttime strides  caged red lights activated  rain pelts a lone pane 
is what changes gone  does this fabrics golden weave  have its will or mine 
surely there must be more  life can't be just jobs and bills  when can i have fun 
smoke down sawmill road  smell of mesquite piñon sage  sparse patches of snow 
accept these feelings  for they are temporary  and life will move on 
seeds in handplanted  nourishment and harvestyours  such joy in your work 
freya i beseech   my internal war rages   love lost i am lost 
this bat soup is good  oh no the whole world is dead  coronavirus 
tears of wax aflame  descending steadily down  a crying candle 
dont fear truth concealed  a sea of irrelevance  that's where truth will drown 
shall i compare thee  to a summers day alas  it shall not be done 
engaging force field  cloaking visibility  imbeciles bounce off 
as winter beckons   the crops begin to wilt   and snow falls again 
you jumping on me  covered in pink polka dots  no reason but love 
don't know what it means  to be a human being  i know what it's like 
knuckles turn pale white  as i lean over the edge  i slip then regret 
sitting here i be  writing this haiku for you  hoping for some praise 
fresh morning air  warm bread and hot tea  feeling cozy inside 
hitler as you know  came from a whole family  who used to hitle 
always you lead me  my footprint in your imprint  with each step there's love 
do you remember  i know i am late to this  love changes the mind 
having hit submit   your anonymous applause   the author awaits 
the morning birdsongs  a delightful melody  music to my ears 
nazis on the run   they live in argentina   let's leave them alone 
my penis fell off  so my hot glue gun fixed it  now i am crippled 
im a courier   i help santa at christmas   never once said thanks 
the avante garde nature  of a fresh four lined haiku  they might be the future 
i had to tell him  a secret i was hiding  he was not my son 
then there was your smile  then my life changed forever  then my soul sangthanks 
men and honesty  although not complete strangers  can pass each other 
autumn winds blow hard  loud rain announces spring  winter snow is mute 
times passes the leaves fall  but the world stands still  waiting for a cure 
old age pads your mind  like fat and bad memories  hard to get rid of 
is that all you have  a blackberry lemonade  a tart empty life 
change begins right now  let music and dance commence  coordination 
these wonderful things  are misery within to  those who possess them 
since mum passed away  my whole world is upside down  where are the clean clothes 
cool mornings embrace  sparkling dew in the sunlight  thoughts of you linger 
there're traces of you  across all sensory domains  fused in every spring 
awaiting sadness  my love seeks another yet  the ocean is calm 
invisible bricks  construct imaginary  blockades with purpose 
suddenly i smile  as we stare at the sunrise  because i met you 
have i known of you  your beaten brow i have once kissed  i soften for you 
fluorescent flickers  bare feet cold on the roadway   empty headed fool 
friends since we were kids  we don't have to put masks on  we can be ourselves 
so it's my cake day  it shouldn't be a surprise  it comes every year 
chrysanthemum bod  accepting all of the bees  how indecent you 
i find this girl cool  texting her is like a dream   i kinda love her 
after every drink  she took another dosage  of her medicine 
look at the sun's face  tell me that joy wasn't born  in the dark of space 
new moon darkling black   silent shadow sucking scar  shining claw come back 
a pair of jade spheres  brilliant in their dullness  blink and i am lost 
im in love with you  i carry on like im not  im hurting myself 
bass line walks and talks  with my headphones on i smile   listening to jazz 
you are more than just  those arbitrary labels  that you hide behind 
long branches before  becoming a messy knot  unfurled to the sea 
the bloated green leaf  shudders in the utmost fear  of cold northern winds 
camping in autumn  awakened by falling leaves  landing on my face 
on the porch one night  i helped him to cry by just  silently rocking 
crowd of witnesses  so we areservants also  filled with hope and joy 
the sun keeps rising  to teach us the meaning of  road slush and red lights 
nothing left to say  everything out in the open  bared for all to see 
how to milk almonds  step one gather all your nuts  step two buy real milk 
time will keep ticking  and you will get older  but always be young 
ambulance siren  for whom does it hurry now  it hurries for me 
somebody saved me  from myself i go through life  with my eyes wide shut 
cold lifeless sleep ends  animals slowly emerge  earth reawakens 
how unnatural  are all the crowded places   with no one around 
poetry my art  can't draw nor paint sing or dance   words are all i have 
this generation  fingers in bad bad places  electronica 
dancing in the wind  thin and fragile in the end  go begin again 
drawing herself close  his shoulders tense on the seat  they are not lovers 
days eating creamed corn  nights spent studying your face  our education 
home in a vowel  and a scrubby consonant  spelling out sparrows 
autumn winds blow hard  loud rain announces each spring  winter snow falls mute 
night fades with first light  sun's returning it's all right  time for a haiku 
still in the present  moving toward the future  rewinding the past 
terrified of this  demon that keeps haunting me  you will not best me 
hot ashes drift down  blanketing the earth with snow  for our last winter 
giving to strangers   spreads faith in humanity  you are loved my friend 
share in happiness   it's the good times that will stick   get over yourself 
jade green navy blue  we wait alone together  a sunrise from you 
forever itching  the river swirls and stretches  begging for a scratch 
turning into dust  with the moon under my feet  i'm getting older 
the forsaken day  many raiders assemble  run like naruto 
i cut off his hand  pleading i reveal the truth  i am your father 
waiting for the stick  the one they jam up your nose  covid testing woes 
eating by myself  i'm not as good as porn  another drink please 
water in the hand  happiness is ephemeral  a kiss from the wind 
leftovers of your  existence scattered round the  apartment we shared 
the nighttime thunder  frightens animals and birds  my peaceful slumber 
like kissing stardust  i become engulfed by you  swallowing me whole 
autumn leaves falling   barren trees under grey clouds   empty until spring 
inspired by you  i prepare to teach and share  thank you lord jesus 
a bright shooting star  you flew through my bleak dark life  i miss your warm glow 
my own reflection  fades away into the glass  with each sip i take 
there's a wasp in here  leave and i will let you live  please do not sting me 
my heart beats for her  the one who can give me life  the one who takes it 
the pain stays hidden  so they might live their lives right  i gladly suffer 
oak rooted alone   but just over the hillside   lie an entire grove 
the globe is changing  an end to modernity  our bones will stand watch 
whoosh brisk wind blows cold  cuts to the core bundle up  cocoa brings warmth 
pale afternoon sky  a breeze invites trees to dance  wind chimes sing along 
sweet unscented toll  forgive the bright firelight  so bright we may burn 
pain in your body   disappointment in your soul   beauty still within 
voice sweet like honey   fluttering heart when eyes laid   you are my one wish 
the heavens shine down  constellations drawn by man  stories to be told 
of the stages five  denial is the most fun  ignorance is bliss 
the false friends stalk you  the snakes constantly deceive  crush them underfoot 
aimless wanderer  a soul without home or kin  an unwanted stray 
her laugh breaks the night  fills the air with ancient sounds  a dark opera 
watercolored skies  reflect off the stepping stones  lighting the cats face 
i breathe a small cloud  in space it hangs keeping shape  no breeze to stir it 
wonderfully made  god's image likeness are we  love is our purpose 
spent the day outside  wasted the watercolor  suppose i'll need more 
they say that when you die  you go up into the sky  but i'm afraid of heights 
sky spouts of water   from which cloud villages drink  to quench their dry throats 
refrigerator  refrigerator again  refrigerator 
in our darkest hour  seeking brightest light will act  as beacon of hope 
the kaiju appears  behold humanity's end  king of the monsters 
you won't hold me now  yet still my clipped wings will hurt  must you hold me down 
my problem with drugs   i love to take them   i hate to stop 
all of life's lessons  begin with a single step  into the unknown 
ecstacy at work  makes it hard to concentrate  but my desk feels cool 
writing worth reading  pouring ink onto pages  a life worth living 
big larry he tall  got big hands with them bit nails  choke you hard be dead 
heavenly fragrance  drifts through mild breeze what is it  ah hyacinth blooms 
i long for it so  your touch and delicate taste  yet you pull away 
it wastes my time when  problem exists between chair  and keyboard leave me 
chickens counting eggs  the days race by in circuits  born again and blessed 
in my sleep i dream  dreams of life scenarios  imperturbable 
an orange sky rose  deep purple and quiet blue  fade away for day 
breath taken away  heart now seems to be racing  can't believe my eyes 
so many projects  filling my day blessed am i  thanks for the help lord 
sparks in velvet dark  beautiful enchanting bright  memories of you 
an eagle flies free  the king for a thousand years  ride the sky child 
cars are passing by  always eager to go back  this road takes us home 
beyond meat burger  small french fries and small iced tea  beyond basic lunch 
now i see the point  no more running after smoke  dancing with the flames 
forget emotions  erase lingering feelings  sweet sweet catharsis 
goddess of the sleep  how long will you hide from me  show up embrace me 
look into my eyes  a fallen king with no throne  i am a tyrant 
as the leaves sink down  the temperature drops too  my heart falls with them 
winter is coming  a song of ice and of fire  it's a game of thrones 
in isolation    date night is facials and wine    maybe a foot rub 
digital scrolls lost  bytes cascade as grains of sand  dunes line the landscape 
the dark sky lowered  silver gift from the heavens   i just a small tree 
the mountains will rise   the shadows will grow with them   bathing us in black 
a thousand lifetimes  of sin glass stained with crimson  bloody sunrise dawns 
trillions of planets  think of all the love stories  a universe full 
united in faith  brief steps to eternity  always love for you 
seeds are sown on ground  seeds will grow and be  trees will be cut down 
make love deterrence  a world for the children  a world free of spears 
your love gives me strength  i stumble and you are there  lord such perfect love 
holding his great bow  he strides down the mountainside  vengeful apollo 
to livestock i say  must be nice to be wanted  even just as meat 
dark clouds split apart  a warm presence is now felt  as light bathes the world 
one more sleepless night   haunted by our memories   the ones i still love 
at the dmv  everyone waits far too long  wait did i miss it 
lonely water drop  comes into another drop  to form something big 
eating an apple   and thinking about you   the and of the day 
dark end of tunnel  not seeing light in future  learn to live alone 
things are getting real  instead of burning too bright  we simmer each night 
this is beautiful   holding your perfume fingers  looking at nature 
woke up from the womb  the previous life was just  a terrible dream 
small drops fall wetly  could this be a spring shower  no sunshine cuts through 
humid lighting storm  summer in san francisco  the apocalypse 
traditionally  seventeen syllables make  a meta haiku 
winter marine fog  condensing life into death  near a pumpkin patch 
feeling worthlessness  broken beaten left for dead  arise a new dawn 
loud possessed masses  scrambled minds mad like cracked eggs  make hard times harder 
most planets are bleak  but when the conditions are ripe  you can buy ice cream 
lightning decided  for no apparent reason  to hit the old man 
afton family  no living one among them  nothing left but hate 
i'm afraid to love   i've been torn too many times  just leave me alone 
fire smothered in my guts   i light a cigarette to burn   my palate and throat 
 can't negotiate  your release because fool you  took yourself hostage 
birds larked in the dusk  so the night waited for its  elusive brunette 
mole constellations  cosmos ever expanding  love you anyway 
caught in summer rain  running to hide but laughing  cause we are in love 
blessed on thanksgiving   cinnamon is a warm hug  stretch pants are a must 
when man takes a road  that leads to certain ruin  trip tie and bind him 
eating an apple   and thinking about you   the end of the day 
swipe right for a like   swipe left for a try again   tinder gods help me 
with one single snap   the sub perfectly balanced   as all things should be 
a turn of events  that makes very little sense  possibilities 
a muted panic  people are leaving quickly  somebody coughing 
i love the way you  live in my life and fill the  spaces with your you 
i called my boss dad  my boss is not my father  going home early 
longest evenings   pink clouds cornflower blue skies  oh how i love june 
unexpected change  a mountain creek springs from stone  wonder where it flows 
beautiful garçon  absolutely breathtaking  and yet so boring 
why is it always  the best of us that get hurt  no one notices 
i can't sing or draw  but at least i have haikus  to express myself 
manly suicide  is the struggle up the path  to meet the reaper 
one for the bucket  and one for both of the bails  who will carry whom 
my dearest neighbor  can you please play something else  same song every day 
autumnal essence  sweet scent of summer fading  winter foreboding 
removed posts lead to  wonder and excitement but  we will never see 
walking in the dunes  following paths made by deer  hoof prints in the sand 
splashes of red blood  welts of dark bruises from pain  murdered by artform 
love's a funny thing  say you mean the world to them  and then someone else 
look to the future  tomorrow learn mandarin  thereafter speak gold 
birds chirp happily  world thaws from winter slumber  dour meadow finds color 
an obese turtle  on its back in the hot sun  flailing his time done 
i sit on the lawn  beer in my hand a cold one  i watch the fireworks 
your words embraced me  such joy filled my heart and soul  fixed in memory 
when was the last time  that you looked for something new  are you even there 
my sweet birdy girl  lying cozy on my lap  what do you dream of 
breaking bread with friends  wine flowing like crimson tide  a breath of fresh air 
five feet separates  my computer from my bed   my daily commute 
i do have good friends  but one thought just makes me blue  no one's really here 
a sea of darkness  while a defiant blue speck  stands strong and vast yet 
in this day and age   you cannot trust anyone   always turn your back 
an ember light casts  relief in emerald whispers  a floral perfume 
it has been some time  rainclouds were discipating  the storm gets closer 
when we shoot the breeze  in friendly conversation  do we hurt the air 
my mare keeps me up   she trots across tired eyes   sweet mare of the night 
how many years trapped  overthinking every thought  slowly losing time 
wasting time with tech  life too short for these issues  can i walk away 
the moon has risen   beaming down to guide my way   lost but found but lost 
a world divided  ignore the differences  look for common ground 
an askreddit post  question is what love feels like  do i even know 
my heart beat quickens   life is to short to stop now   bliss as our lips touch 
memories of youth  hopes and dreams we shared my love  for now forever 
sometimes i can laugh  at slightly sinister things  even at my kids 
ya'll want a haiku  you want a fucking haiku  well then there you go 
i made pancakes  i shared with everybody  taste of childhood gone 
sporting a black eye  and snuffing out the sun while  the moon took over 
when sweet evening comes  i feel my life exhaling  i bask in gladness 
everything changes  the way i feel about life  changes everything 
stones smooth to the touch  have all been smashed and worn down  by the earth's rivers 
sovngarde waits for me  leave for golden halls goodbye  frozen mountain home 
like a house of cards   my cultivated habits   have fallen apart 
infectious your smile  comforting your words of love  thanks for you 
everywhere are you  culture blinds the path you you   grab our hands now hug 
talking to my plants   my spirit is withering   this cool season 
binge watching kung fu  on amazon prime tv  oh those seventies 
six years of journey  thirteen years full of wonders  wonders to the end 
i know some people  who would benefit from a  loooong slooow rooot canal 
my motivation  flickers like a dying light  bright one day then dim 
bad leads to okay  okay leads to good then great  this is a haiku 
a year drifted by  our new normal is apart  just sign the papers 
we can only hope  that a dark reddit ui  now brightens the mood 
blood vessels branch out  from frozen hearts and grey flesh  black trees of winter 
a glowing ember  must not held too firmly  or it will expire 
i never take the  fast easy road anywhere  but i still get there 
hear the cicadas   so alien and haunting  like a waking dream 
it's always black or white  never a shade of grey   troubles never stay away 
pain within i see  a prayer for you this day  can i dry the tears 
light the wood matchstick to ash   look up and wonder   where did all the green trees go 
rustling lilies  betraying a lurking cat  grasshopper crunches 
motivation i  lack it now i'm simply   procrastinating 
each day i climb  climb out that bunker of mine  only to fall deeper 
fragmented tiles  a man reading mosaics  dodged grout worn faces 
the space is so big  boundless possibilities  makes me feel so small 
your thoughts kept private  how i long to share with you  love tears bridge the gap 
foul mouthed chain smoking  hard drinking crazy red hair  punk rock fucking love 
the littlelest corpse  was not the slowest around  others had lost legs 
garden beat by weeds   i accept this great challenge   as i plant a seed 
new toilet paper  one question must be answered  under or over 
it's news in haikus  news is in the body text  brought to you by fun 
socially distanced  wishing i could hug you all  i miss human touch 
through the panes of glass   the light is out of the eyes   it shines in the heart 
she has no money  christmas will be hard this year  with three mouths to feed 
challenged you went forth  you reasoned the answer wow  let us now thank god 
still waters disturbed  concentric ripples shimmer  a surfacing loon 
who's that over there  did not say just came and went  anonymously 
please meet me halfway  you step forward he steps back  please meet me halfway 
the serenity  summer gives to autumn time  leaves fall gently down 
your attic monsters  with a flashlight together  are just furniture 
run through your soft hair  dive into your rough tanned skin  get lost in your eyes 
ultimate cuddles  let's become octopuses  no bones only beaks 
as the city sleeps  silence grows the air freshens  perfect for deep thoughts 
how i want your care  how i desire your touch  how i need your love 
best friend or girlfriend  i have so many girl friends  in love with them all 
fields of green stood still  then the zephyr sang its song  emerald blades dance 
life is breathtaking  like a vine around my throat  time for some pruning 
the cloud drifts aloft  who knew a mountain could be  a feather also 
i am hungover  the thought of booze makes me sick  happy new year friends 
he also wonders at night  my mind searches for a face  we will meet someday 
my unforetold love  swept over me like a wave  and eyes just as blue 
open the door babe  i'm sorry for everything  please just let me in 
possibilities  innocence in the real world  probabilities 
a wasted year gone  drinking beer and having fun  oh to time travel 
big sweaty penis  slapping around in my ass  oh no i'm shitting 
yes yes yes yes yes  no no no no no no no  probably been done 
make fire in cave  hit big cat with my death rock  ooga booga 
dreaming of success  wishes of being debt free  where do i begin 
i am no poet  i write haiku though sometimes  pretentious at best 
tonight the moon mourns   wind sweeping her thin gray veil   conceals her sorrow 
soothing walls of steam  hot soap just went through my thighs  hands tight on the wall 
your eyes skim right past  one among thousand others  just another poem 
hokku became haiku  languages began to vary  the beauty remains 
april amplifies  cranking the volume for the  music of songbirds 
you claim to love christ  but fail to ask yourself  if he would approve 
massive angry beasts   out for blood and nothing else   creatures of nightmares 
sun crowns the peaks  village slumbers underneath  a blanket of clouds 
cup of tea simply   steaming in shaft of sunlight   magnificent scent 
i was a moonbeam   shining on a plastic bag   old ripped and dusty 
i can feel it too   so what am i waiting for   i'm afraid of you 
you need to believe  i need to learn trust again  we once had the two 
bees bumble above  grass bends beneath necks and knees  let's become honey 
are your nipples free  somebody asked me online  i told him they were 
only ideal worlds  tether ethical truths  to this imperfect one 
stuck on time loop   unending repititions   don't know why i am 
starshine horizon  this gravity can save us  breaking the red shift 
the ruler of hell  eye of the witch at the graves  the king of diamonds 
this is how she bleeds  bright red drops on a white floor  pretending all's well 
start of my haiku  this haiku might not make sense  this does not make sense 
moving is pointless  i have always been this way  slipping through the cracks 
i turn on my switch   played mario odyssey   until three am 
sexy girl ahead  can not concentrate anymore  studying does suck 
how anxious am i  to see black powdery smoke  poison the blue sky 
yellow flicked to red  a preposterous distance  gunned it anyway 
lets burn everything  tim where'd you put the lighter  you left it at home 
an image of trees  the rain starting to move by  quiet cicadas 
my butt sure is cold  it seems i forgot something  ah i left without my pants 
a child's bicycle  upended in the backyard  echoes of laughter 
a life is fleeting  just like the falling blossom  allow the scatter 
been feeling so low  but it cannot hurt us now  i don't give a fuck 
a cold stormy night  rain has washed away the day  fresh start tomorrow 
you don't owe the past  the only thing that lingers  is your wasted time 
desert and mountains  what lay between us is vast  today you felt close 
the silly blue hat  blends with your ocean eyes  seeping into me 
buffet for bunnies  all you can eat vegetables  fenced off in the yard 
there is a darkness  ache just below the surface  just fighting for air 
tears flood down my cheek   meaningless to your cold heart   i pray to be free 
consolidation   unyielding in effort to   assimilation 
and then the sun set  the light from a million stars  brought tears to my eyes 
god will pay for this  that deceitful piece of shit  wipe it off the earth 
the hawk swoops down to  the tree in which it nests i  too wish for my nest 
a summer evening  trash tv popcorn and you  put you phone away 
heart flutters each time  you spare a moment for me  too late see your ring 
you me together   staring at the moonlit sky   heartbeats are in sync 
an ombre of colors  paints the darkest of my skies  when you are around 
hard at work i sleep  in the hazel lilac shade  extended lunchbreak 
only those without  wings can defy gravity  some skies aren't enough 
an eyerish poet  full of piss and vinegar  drinks his guinness slow 
thin howling pressure  in the pit of my stomach  plummet to concrete 
red ribbon draping  all down the arch of her back  she is so lovely 
in the cool water  the moon cuts a white ripple  the calm of the night 
it is a long quest  millions of teas and teapots  find yours be happy 
cut off from the pod  a porpoise was leaping and  looked for other kites 
all i do is check   the fridge again and again  nothing changes 
life is just a loop  everything comes and goes  love is no different 
it's that time year  eyes leak nose drips throat itch  i hate hayfever 
acrid memories  fill each and every crevice  i won't miss this place 
deep breaths of warm air  barbeques and wet pavement  fragrance of summer 
always calm  forever thirsty  deserts drink 
her lipstick was red  what colour was her dress red  her shoes too were red 
reading poetry   by people i've never met   it keeps me alive 
anticipation  washing salty cars in spring  flurries in three days 
bread and circuses   surround me both of my sides   there is no escape 
branch mandala spin   silent hum throughout the house   encapsulating 
the leaves start to change  pumpkins begin to ripen  year draws to a close 
wet season arrives  with muddy hems and soft groans  black umbrellas bloom 
organization  getting syllables correct  meticulous verse 
once upon a list  of my most frustrating things  watching my son sweep 
a melody in  to another flows a third  divine counterpoint 
here we are again  another fork in the road  are you still coming 
each passing second  will mean a minute longer  i can barely sleep 
formulating plans  exit strategy of sorts  slowly but surely 
by myself again  will you keep me company  to get through this night 
life is but a whim  for beauty is to behold  death the final breathe 
poor lonely bluebird  a full life of skipping trees  full of leaves and stays 
adulting is hard  no trophies for being real  all you get are scars 
golden blooming light  gentle whispers in the wind  heart searching on end 
good morning i lie  you leave don't say i love you  ah marital bliss 
solitary bee  make a home between my ears  an old light fixture 
i like the to write raps  marathon of words running  some syllable laps 
a hanging basket  blooming with orange blossoms in  an oriole's nest 
my phone  reflected  the passing clouds 
a giant stone slab  the t'zolkin predicted change  end of our era 
my life is a waste  i knew it was from the start  i want to go home 
nothing seems to last   evening star you come so fast   roads wear a white mask 
i used to like it  my writing voice really did  but then i heard yours 
waiting for so long  he'll come back for me one day  raggedy doctor 
the wind through my hair  and canvassed as criminal  had given me knots 
a conversation   of how i met you today   warm notion respond 
when debugging code  my time is tracked by counting  the mugs of coffee 
a still harvest moon  flutters over the lagoon  where a duck jumped in 
sometimes i kiss you  to steal some of your chapstick  i hope that's ok 
absolutely still  not one leaf moves in the heat  indian summer 
our generation  we just want to be wanted  why is that so hard 
a fresh start is nigh   a little slice of death no   then new life at dawn 
vaping on the bus  no one looking inhale  happy journey now 
dark at five o'clock  it seems like daylight savings  account has no funds 
blood is on your hands  want your freedom so you can  revel in my death 
chilly autumn morn  eager paws trample dead leaves  a squeaky bounty hides 
victory coffee  torture me and rebuild me  i love big brother 
do you realise  they said eyes moist with wonder  what this bomb could do 
interestly  your eyes caught me by surprise  guessing their colour 
three thrasher mags  hiding a pile of playboys  eighth grade polaroid 
the dork in my heart  brings me joy and ecstasy  this girl is just love 
amber is so rad  she makes me feel really good  i really love her 
weird to realise  thoughts are the loudest silence  a shallow ocean 
empty recliner  and dark television screen  constant reminders 
boo did i scare you  it's me i'm the living dead  happy halloween 
earlier today  a small decoration sleeps  a ceramic duck 
a lonely rose lives  though old leaves begin to fall  now a new bud grows 
petal bliss is yours  breathless at a moments thought  never shall we touch 
water filled with mud  only reflects distortions  fragmentary truths 
this calm valley path   the breath of the spring winds cool   this path has stories 
snowflakes falling  as the household slumbers  too soon for reindeer 
it comes from nowhere  to torture me with its shade  the thought of death stays 
multiple choice test  what does future hold for me  a b c or d 
always hating me   forever resenting me   never forgiving 
spiders siphon screams  morning showers come to pass  insects crave a voice 
seamless clouded skies  cloak the deep autumn sunset  wet leaves cling to wool 
scrolling scrolling more  smiling faces lost to me  icicles for bones 
midsummer sunlight  peeks into the garden cove  bare skin bathed in gold 
dreams are effortless  which is why dreaming is more  popular than work 
this beautiful life  full of wonder and intrigue   always amazes 
i begged for mercy  but all i heard was silence  while i bled to death 
difficult loves start  at the absence of speaking  hearts yearn to listen 
waiting for something  such as a conversation  to start or something 
richer the world is   even when isolated   to have you in it 
smell autumn's breeze  the smallest trickles of rain   race past branches and leafs 
i long to see stars  but i live in a city  there's no starlight here 
a bittersweet night  clearing my head in a park  need to clear my heart 
get back on your game  in the lengthening of days  and run out your hit 
shrinking myself to   make the love you give me seem   plenty and complete 
thousand sparkling suns  greet me on my morning walk  dew drops on grass tips 
i rolled all your socks  folded your clean underwear  happy valentines 
love you're like the sun  whenever you walk on by  darkness steps aside 
watch you set this fire  to destroy the evidence  that you once loved me 
an iron cannon  is loaded in peacetime with  birds packing a truce 
scotch whisky blend   trays down and seatbelts fastened   i'm drunk in tokyo 
dating the new  still thinking about the old  why can't i move on 
husband is away  blinds down door locked phone off hook  a secret affair 
twenty six minutes  i've cried out and chipped away  no one seems to care 
i can see the little pieces   is it the blurry chaotic mess of sentience   or  am i fragmented 
let us run away  out where no one can find us  we'll laugh at the world 
pleasure turns to chore  once unique it's now routine  and time rages on 
he said come and see  as the seal broke i embraced  changes are coming 
the world keeps turning  i can feel it turn away  was i ever there 
neglected puppy   will never grow to full height   watair your cermet 
songbird on a branch  fresh snow falls  melts on warm cheeks 
trying too hard is  envious of loveliness  wearing modesty 
encrypted sonnets  scrawled in old sidewalk patois  whisp'ring my vices 
round and round you go  pressed into the grooves you sing  nourishing my soul 
i feel things deeply  but speaking in emotions  always makes me choke 
dark at five o'clock  it seems the daylight savings  account has no funds 
i carry your words  etched on paper brain and heart  tattooed on my soul 
in the midnight hour  crickets chirp in agony  frogs croak with delight 
thoughts start to regress  too far down in the abyss  embraced by darkness 
tunes dance oh such joy  imbibed infused playing on  broadcasting my love 
the bud disappears  to let the blossom break through  death rewards living 
a river willow  under it the waters pool  perfect reflection 
well hello reddit  i have written a haiku  and you have read it 
the blue light special  reservations are made for  appearing in court 
green leaf drifts away  rushing aimless in the wind  brown spot autumn nears 
summer boils the blood  fools let it go to their head  cool down with a drink

if your erection  lasts longer than four stories  call your contractor 
i can't fall asleep  the faces in the window  are waiting to pounce 
starving baby bird  nobody will come for you  choose your end amd fly 
bumps and hurdles  proceeding with trust and confidence  with me thanks 
why the resistance   to the thoughts i have of you   we use to be close 
the entrance buzzed while  antennae saluting was  admitting their stripes 
though truth deeply cuts  clarity with heartfelt warmth  is my wish for you 
sharpening my pen  flustered from the thought of you  my pencil ruined 
hands clasp together  bitter cold bites to the bone  yet like fire i burn 
master he could be  small hands around a huge neck  if yoda played bass 
ghost of tsushima  taught me that i hate haikus  assassin's creed better 
feather fur and fin  witnesses to deity  is all creation 
a little tyrant  with bleached bones in a neat row  celebrating death 
sugar maples tapped  slow sap drips into buckets  sap boiled makes syrup 
snow falls quietly  silence is all that is heard  warm vapor exhaled 
the last bit of light   a blue gradient of night   as darkness decends 
just another one  i'm just not pretty enough  rejected again 
thor brings lightning forth   striking hammer on anvil   lightning splits the sky 
raindrops massage me  upon a boat in the sea   being rocked gently 
i won't kill myself  so many things left to do  my list is all drugs 
my spiral tower  evaporates like spring snow  a church bell ringing 
i open the door  dust crumbles beneath my feet  i look away too 
searching for the light  peace love and understanding  what is so funny 
i've been looking down  focusing on not falling  blind to the journey 
oh the thunderstorm   patter swish exuberance  stay in the moment 
sucked your tongue  don't know why this i regret  pot maybe i think 
in the box and out  we like to move them around  stop and let them be 
flashbacks and trauma  memories and dreams seem real  will i lose myself 
where has the time gone  that is not my reflection   pieces on the floor 
contemplate this thought  you will not get this day back  the room went silent 
behind this visage  i'm more than my surface shows  must repair the cracks 
you're so beautiful  photographs and memories  don't do you justice 
christmas trees and fights  a family fragmentized  cold nights bring bad times 
once truth can be known  faith is unnecessary  and everywhere 
fall leaves sway on the  willamette babbling over  moss stones past a hill 
on apps full of men  always potential for love  i'll just masturbate 
studying a bit  break then procrastination  never back in track 
a vivid sunset  shines so bright and beautiful  but oh so short lived

feeling the freedom  floating above the water  staring at the sky 
oh my god i swear  why is everything on here  so dark and edgy 
the morning brings us  a shining new horizon  this brand new skyline 
tempered glass towers  manufactured for the gods  rust covered shovel 
come pollinators  corolla coloured brightly  on to the stigma 
tinder gold purchased  wanted to see all my matches  too bad there are none

parking lot oak tree  a fat man sits homeless again  my turn signal plinks 
regretting life choices  while eating some cookies  painful cavities 
long after i've gone  trees whisper to each other  with unheard echoes 
sat on the toilet   no tp sink and a hand   problem solving skills 
sporting a black eye  and snuffing out the sun had  the moon take over 
i hear your name in  silence and i see your face  in an empty room 
cold air burns my lungs  while the wind it chaps my face  smile frozen jogging 
go leave me alone  sitting here on what i call  my lone empty throne 
spider's eyes  in the grass shimmer  like the stars

january sun  pries open red rheumy eyes  and wine soaked regret 
deep under the earth  lost within human traffic  we wait for a train

a face of soft silk   warm rays in the skin reflects  gentle touch of love 
anger swift harsh and bloody  soothed by gentle words soft touches  turned to cool water dripping off forest moss 
she smiled at me  as she stood up from the floor  and brushed off her knees

the passenger seat  an extra cutlery set  without a cohort 
take back what i said  he sent out another voltorb  self destructed again 
the scent of amber  my nose in her hair inhales  close my eyes and smile 
just a peek  fuels my faith and hope  love you lord 
blinded by the smog  can't stop me from seeing straight  breathe in and breathe out 
the reason you left  was it because you ran out  of reasons to stay 
locking all the doors  an ocean surrounding me  i got to break free 
we remember when  smiles frowns cries of joy and pain  ever family 
in a raging storm  mind completely calm within  beyond all the noise 
i can hear my heart  as the noose starts to tighten  and time starts to slide

personalities  each one slightly different  multiple to please

i'm constipated   tryna think of a haiku   nothing is coming 
white flower blooming  out of place one might have said  growing here early 
warm crackling fire  popcorn and a good movie  lazy afternoon 
can i see the love  looking past pain suffering  such wisdom for me 
passing of time  decay approaches slowly  time takes it's toll 
daybreak comes at last  now the dark of night is past  have a nice breakfast 
having the answers  inquisitive by nature  knowing the unknown 
a beautiful star  brightest i have ever seen  shines inside of you 
you're the solution  to every problem that  you have created 
if saying goodbye  i suppose i should start by  taking off my shoes 
in the darkness   we reach out blindly  yet i have found you 
upsets and setbacks  each step plagued by entropy  john sixteen three three 
chubby cats on rafts  they float downstream back to back  old felines relax 
flex when you have to  you do not know your place yet  the flex is mine bitch 
i see the spirit   she crawls toward my throat   do i deserve this 
will you ever learn  see things as they really are  like i see the world 
i kilm with kindness  while i suffer in silence  we all die alone 
endless road ahead  the overcast sky hangs low  i am coming home 
spring sunshine and rain  life restored grows rapidly  love seen in it all 
your hope faith shines forth  glimpse of god you shared with me  how great is our god 
bare knuckle boxing  with a tear covered pillow  insomnia woes 
another weekend  filled up by ambitious plans  ends with hangover 
all the pretty things   i tried to be to please   the whore inside me 
laying next to you  breathing becomes easier   daydreams melt to sleep 
my next month depends  on whether i choose to buy  indica or sativa 
books are like twitter  you read and read with pictures  every so often 
restless stirring   long forgotten visages   a practiced tumble 
a cold silence  human joys and sorrows loud  once again mere silence 
work and cost to live   leaves me very little time   to practice haiku 
kissing your edges  the space between lips is ours  until it is closed 
the car slowly cools  dull winter dirty snow sky  coffee would be nice 
hand sanitizer  hero of the pandemic  bane of paper cuts 
obnoxiousork writes  bad haikus that use lots of  enjanbment to work 
some cherish problems  and show their contempt for those  who see to solve them 
a cool brush of my face  warm rays cast by the blue sky  cool air fills my lungs 
forgetting to eat   now i am forgoing sleep   passion found at last 
sunset sails over seas   wind blowing in the trees   soon we shall fly free 
leaves of amber wings  lost by autumn's equinox  sheen at dawn of spring 
third day of snow   landlord says just one more week   daddy pays the bills 
a sea of faces  neon lights buzz overhead  the android walked on 
here's to wallowing  when you're feeling really sad  ignore all others 
being aware of   being aware allows thoughts   to lose their power 
your words become mine  it is you they hear not me  amazed am i thanks 
two wingback chairs sit  swept dirt under magnolias  august lazes on 
bowerbird's glamour  shiny objects spread neatly  looking for a mate 
compartmentalize  the boxes compose the space  puzzle games to see 
i stayed up all night   restless mind wanders to you   arms anchor me still 
you killed my father  i'm inigo montoya  now prepare to die 
the light of the moon   shimmers on the trout a time   attracting the crane 
like a young person  strong defiant vulnerable  small tree on the hill 
autumn colours fall  sounding of wind streams and life  new beginnings soon 
that is all they do  manipulate ignorance  what are they hiding 
do you want to hear  the words that were left unsaid  what i want to say 
i do not falter  on the steep and savage path  but for the poet 
tend to love like plants  letting it grow fast or slow  as the souls will glow 
drunken thoughts burning  a sparrow weeps on this day  unbelieved wounded 
forest of trees each  differently imperfect  not unlike ourselves 
the cry of a loon  summer breeze of the lake  cottage door locked 
the last smile i saw  weary eyes with a huge heart  i miss you nonna 
failing to give thanks  how can you love me so much  ever blessed am i 
light and dark are matched   a moment of equipoise   as the seasons change 
i wrote a haiku  i feel it should be deep but  i lost my shovel 
i miss the old times  i wish we could just go back  when there was still love 
i think i know why   we do things that we do   we just want to exist 
your flower blossoms   your petals glisten with dew   i'm buzzing for you 
i bought a puppy  a dagger into my heart  because all things die 
i say marhaban  she smiles at a word from home  in a foreign land 
i lie deathly still   the world around me moves on   unfazed undeterred 
i'm a guillotine   some deserve their severance   wealth can't save you now 
hair on the tile floor  fully booked with dream clients  success in passion 
incense smoke rises  through fall afternoon sunlight  cars sounds like river 
is this chance or fate  a tree of contingencies  or a scripted play 
this moon is ancient  and the darkness that awes you  gnaws at you is too 
forbidden knowledge  the alchemist family  became king of kings 
dried dying flower   waiting for the rain to fall   never gets its wish 
stranger than fiction  an inescapable truth  to live we must die 
busy loving you  love freely given each day  such is my purpose 
scattered by the wind   the heat of summer long gone   you're all that remains 
handfuls of roses  fingers bloodied by the thorns  each drop is a gift 
powering onward  to pivot reposition  shifting gears boldly 
are they listening  i feel like they always are  alexa weather 
saturn pulls my thoughts   as he returns i wonder   what i'm doing here 
color everywhere   the dancing shapes of my dreams   purple gold and blue 
big emergency  guys i need some help right now  mom found the poop sock 
eternal waiting  wake to sleep at nausea  forever a dream 
darkness approaches  something evil this way comes  run away and hide 
i have a question  is pickpocketing a crime  if you don't get caught 
dream about a thought  an escape from the moment  where i cannot be 
you dream for your child  and too soon that dream comes true  and yet your heart breaks 
i have gained knowledge  grown up yet still i retain  my youthful acne 
winds caress my face  salt bombarding the senses  soon back in the car 
wet heavy storm clouds  gather over a corn field  fist pounds on the door 
last night i bought shoes  oh not in real life mind you  this was in a dream 
grey cat hunts all day   best part of lockdown by far   zapped after so long 
uninhibited  please be nothing more than raw  honest and truthful 
first class stamps to vote  to a cash register ring  democracy ends 
uneasy skies   anxious winds howl through the trees   blowing doubt my way 
serious question  for people who study snakes  are snakes their own dicks 
rusted mind hungers  craves originality  just farts endlessly 
emptiness and loss   guilt shame longing and grief   tell me i will heal 
bait searching for danger  like a suicidal fish  waiting for a bait 
soft southern accent   clever sarcastic humor   attention captured 
an endless longing  the freedoms i had in youth  never to return 
you hold in your hand  all the answers you could want  if you believe it 
sudden betrayal  an action that cuts factions  trust no more be gone 
be still like nightfall   quiet like the skies above  listen to the earth 
i only need one  word to describe your beauty  intoxicating 
together we learn  truths revealed bring us such joy  happiness awaits 
the umami taste  slurping noodles with hot soup  strangers salivate 
shadow in the night  rust red moon cresting the sky  black cat crosses lot 
the cool ocean breeze  an invigorating scent  i miss the sunsets 
outside of myself  swirling pools of muddied thoughts  ain't no place to swim 
cosmic decadence  though grand is incomparable  to a lover's kiss 
as the stream flows down   so to does the time that we share   i think of that word 
with glasses of love  see without distortion now  such truth sets me free 
sleeping gossamer  corner of my eye you haunt  long gone but still here 
i hate my family   they expect so much of me   i love my family 
armies black and white  moving in tight positions  make our next move count 
opened up to you  but then you didn't respond  what painful silence 
the great true master  beginner from beginning  empty cup retains 
fangs of a reptile  nestled on her shoulder in  a coiling of gold 
leave me alone  don't vibe with you any more  i know it's painful 
never butterflies  always warmth in my whole self  when close to my loved 
dance pretty lilacs   bend delicately softly   whisper in deaf ears 
oh such a moment  gone but locked in memory  how great is our love 
the last cigarette  a ticket to the abyss  i blame the lighter 
missing our mornings  sliding in you late for work  as bob flips burgers 
desert safari  zebras giraffes and lions  at the waterhole 
ugly jealousy  did you look them in the eyes  to me you return 
another pillbox  we fight as one family  fear is in the mind 
last night of october  only the full moon  shows it's true face 
a thought arises  loathed and lost by the spring wind  to be born again 
shrek is my daddy  i want to suck his big cock  cum inside my mouth 
the most pure thing yet  a genuine preference  need to be grounded 
the machine center   cogs gather to celebrate   she keeps it running 
insecurities  the choppiest of waves crash  return to stillness 
obtuse angles  relative to the sun   merely here for now 
i am dressed like shit  a pink shirt and grey sweat pants  no one will see me 
sparrows skid swiftly  between electric cables  dangerous but free 
i loved her like life  never been to california  yea fuck the west coast 
you are a stranger  yet i feel at home content  in your easy smile 
summerremember  together we laughed and played  let's do it again 
blue and crystal waves  warmth dances over the skin  white sand as canvas 
speaking to myself  from the future to the past  fuck don't send that please 
her sexy red heels  made a rousing staccato  stiff necks elongate 
the wall of the house  illuminated in red  the sun is hiding 
memory of you   's your head my shoulder touching   's tears on my hands drying 
characters we play   we become them to escape   the limits of our lives 
what is a birthday  celebrate a happy life  was it worth the pain 
dark thoughts and sad thoughts  voice would give them more power  thoughts not for sharing 
i am so confused  on how to make a haiku  please help me make one 
misguided childhood  reprehensible adult  regrettable death 
the pillars are tall  and the path is tremendous  what is the purpose 
did not lose my mind  the nature of nature changed  and revealed the lies 
i am my own man  different man from my dad  here we are alike 
an angry feeling  steals a moment from your life  you can't get it back 
weary holy weak   the pipe organ is wheezing   please rise already 
and then just like that  not so special after all  i'm nothing to her 
path is victory  understand your tomorrow  acceptance is you 
why'd you tell me that  i don't know what to believe  i'm too old for this 
lungs burning mouth dry   running till the end of time   greatness is the prize 
was i me that night  a night you won't soon forget  or just a body 
let me be your wine  but if you don't drink water  you cannot have it 
i wish to fly high  yet i'm standing here alone  looking at the sky 
why have cut flowers  in funerals i think that  one corpse is enough 
the meds aren't working  drowning gasping for purpose  lifeguards off duty 
silent cold night  winter seeps into my soul  and arms ache for warmth 
had a date decent  took them home start the descent  whip it out d scent 
follow the leader   not who says what he has done   but who does what's said 
independence day  thanks to god for our freedom  in god we must trust 
first job interview  couldn't sleep last night as whole  new world before me 
traveling is nice  just like frank sinatra says  but home is nicer 
sounds through my speakers  my cell phone talks on its own  it hears everything 
i stay up thinking  thoughts of who you think i am  who i think i am 
too cloudy for stars  darkness isn't all there is   let me be your light 
ah child memories  life was simple and blurry  highchair and nuggets 
watching football game   mahomes is doing great stuff   touchdowns like normal 
the lineman hooked a  rope and hung by a thread to  repair the webbing

my trimmer cut the  cable to communicate  the bugs on a web 
i am senryu   retired and seperated   not quite twenty years 
on the road  who walks who drives who rides  who moves 
what kind of machine  has such superfluous parts  those gears of mercy 
citizen am i  eternity in heaven  god's way the best plan 
dropped calls quick goodbyes  needing to believe your lies  loving at a cost 
fallen leaves red brown  mini tornadoes swirl up  chilled face warmed soul 
the wind on my face  feels so lovely feels so pure  then i hit the ground 
heaven reaching walls  contain the chaos outside  the eye of the storm 
monuments of yore  crumbling dust before our eyes  new monuments rise 
feel a pen slipping  how it slips informs the catch  if you can catch it 
people everywhere  celebrating saint patrick  drinking too much beer 
the cold wind blows hard   blowing the leaves off a tree   naked defenseless 
the honk of a goose  an unruly noise it is  to make it press y 
my days feel empty  i simply wait for bedtime  then repeat cycle 
you tilt at windmills  say everything promise not  oh inquisition 
australian heat  harder to drift off to sleep  summer still to come 
life is worth living  what i need to tell myself  to keep my strength up 
years pass in moments  keep your nose to the grindstone  nauseous by the smell 
without younothing  with youall is possible  thanks here i am lord 
your fate closes in  resign yourself to darkness  or just get to work 
one sole stone pebble   tumbling down a steep cliff side   changes history 
once radiant heart  extinguished by betrayal  learns to trust again 
trees happily shake  a tired man deeply sighs  as leaves brush his lips 
the vibrant nature  the bustle of a city  japan and japan 
oh that jingling sound  tail spins and butt shakes ensue  good boys love walkies 
summer time again  laughter heard across the fields  marijuana haze 
i sit on your face   lick it till i am dripping   guantanamo bea 
no satisfaction  satiating desires  only addiction 
heavy eyes dilate  stuck on the lines of your hand  nervously waiting 
i know it was here  they were only small nibbles  where's my chocolate 
the infant is passed  naked feet and small balled fists  galvanized barbs lurk 
walking arm in arm  old elm branches interlaced  leaves fall days shorten 
another delete  now i write only the mods  does this pass muster 
long ago first steps  with you i have traveled well  today let us dance 
bathe your heart in warmth  shower your spirit with love  wash your hair with soap 
the fat man pounds corn  alone and angry sweating  squirrels screech on the roof 
fizzle in dawn light   for love is only a fog   meant to quickly burn 
presidential balls  the best balls let me tell you  horseface can suck them 
flee for your lives  rodney boggle is coming  coming foor you 
condoleeza rice   bloodied my nipples and chest   with her stilettos 
completely useless  i finish nothing i start  even this stupid 
listen to your heart  let it lead you through your life  dance to its rhythm 
smelling of a fart  it turns out it was a shart  a simple mistake 
haikus haikus hai  kus haikus haikus haikus  haikus are my strength 
another morning  i come for cups of coffee  then i go to work 
getting bumped aside  knocked down again and again  always standing up 
ears twitching quickly  its smell alluring his eyes  the shrew in the grass 
trapped within myself  a slave to what i once was  the indignity 
help me push this rock  into the deep green ocean  we're both chained to it 
credit card fraud should  require like phones two factor  authentication 
my collar itches  i told you it was too tight  i'll stay without it 
once we were a thing  and then we were not that thing  love is bananas 
life can be lonely  life can even be cruel  that's pretty much it 
these past couple days  i've seen your heart break in two  he knows you loved him 
two brothers dancing  one goes left and one goes right  they bump their noggins 
jealousy rising  my wife is not responding  but did to my friend 
run to the forest   don't make a sound or move   the masked man is here 
a taste not enough   always precious   rarity is beautiful

gave a duck my bread  i thought he might be my friend  alone with no bread 
invincible now  unstoppable world is mine  power of powder 
puddles look like piss  near the apartments i live  they might as well be 
yes daddy i cry  drool slips from my pouting lips  i feel so little 
i've crunched the numbers   i've ran the simulations   my boredom is fact 
this bright summer day  fleeting taste of paradise  a place in the sun 
a fox keens lopes quick  across the pool of light jumps  next door's wall it's gone 
sometimes i get sad  when my eyes get watery  after a big sneeze 
midsummer sunset  pours into the ocean cove  bare skin bathed in gold 
pushing causes pain  siezing in my narrow bones  i think i'll lay down 
white cherry blossom  turning red and falling down  unexpected gift 
american dream  longing for white picket fence  this is a nightmare 
we are the stillness  of parked cars lining the streets  in the dead of night 
lonely get a dog   if sore get a frog  when surrounded get away 
as sharp as a blade   the calm yet ferocious storm   hardens its resolve 
no amount of air   dirt surrounds me my coffin   screaming is no help 
here in the garden  let's play a game standing still  is the way to go 
baphomet lover   give me validation please   may i join your clique 
warm april breeze rolls  clothes on the line bounce lightly  dancing with wind chimes 
late night little snacks   they're the reason i'm so fat   all night i fridge check 
the most ef a cue   you ask in the morning is   what time is it now 
three faces of self  one you see and one love sees  the last is all mine 
to my right the waves  and to my left cicadas  weave summer night songs 
a thrill like you read about  artists being uncovered  bliss starts pouring out 
a piercing whistle  screams and thunderous applause  drown these sweat and tears 
inside these four walls  dreams meander past the stars  quarantine musing 
steaming hot water  filtered through paper and beans  pourover coffee 
laying on the couch  staring up at the ceiling  wishing you were here 
sail a sugar moon  when next i hear you breathing  until mars has rings 
the prohibition  of art reflecting ideas  death of the haiku 
i also write raps  it's all about play with words  around you like laps 
i'm tired of tears   i deserve better than you  she abandoned me 
you need not worry  this isn't meant to hurt you  it's meant to please me 
she smiles in english  i count my heartbeats in french  parley vous anglais 
shared between us two  a frozen moment a glance  the world starts again 
white gentle giants  traversing the vast blue sky  ever majestic 
days of joy recalled  music we shared notes in tears  hear it dance my loves 
sense of self be gone  born anew of inner being  a new peace within 
it's snowing he said  as if we couldn't see it  people really suck 
i cant write haikus   they are very difficult  oh wait i just did

faith is holding firm  while walking on water and  believing in ice 
season serenade  green verse and rhythmic whistles  cadence to outdoors 
long i wait for god  i slip into oblivion  i still yearn for love 
i miss the desert  the long hikes and dry weather  day dreams of past days 
desire strikes a curse  reading into little things  your effect on me 
singed trees ashen stumps  cancer across the valley  a great erasure 
i hear her laughing  i hear little splashes too  smartphone in bathroom 
sorry your bullshit   is not worth thinking about   better things to do 
here for the winter  our ship is locked in this ice  lets eat each other 
lust caught deep within  encased inside our friendship  buried and concealed 
love sprang in winter  when it died it was april  winter came once more 
our souls intertwine  eyes reflecting the sea's shine  a light sunburn forms 
from a dank basement  a finger smeared by cheetos  dispenses downvotes 
rain clouds follow me  dull grey hues or thunderstorms   the sun is still there 
plant an idea  stirred up swarm of stinging bees  wage a holy war 
winter afternoon  cold black coffee remembered  a plane yawns above 
my blood donations  transported in the woods by  red cross mosquitoes 
i thought of her once  again and i'm ashamed to  say that i smiled 
victorious scream  pierces what's left of your mind  embrace the steel heart 
an empty sad room  ghosts of our past still dance here  goodbye my old friend 
your love inside me   filling up an empty shell   i feel whole again 
monday dilema   to stand on my own two feet   or to marry rich 
my awesome office   cubicle work everywhere   always squeaky clean 
void of all support  my haiku falls in a pit  down the vote you go 
i can't read your mind  every time i turn a page  my fingertips bleed 
stairwell so high up  no matter how many steps  worth seeing the top 
i hate the sunshine  it really depresses me  i love cloudy days

on my tongue burning  rusted leaves fall lost broken  lost highway songbird 
great love lives so close   the sky the ocean the earth   you are not alone 
leaves fall in the brook  circles of ripples widen  happily gurgles 
haikus express pain  otherwise you'll never know  suffer in silence 
you are my bright sun   blinded when i stared too long   i still seek your warmth 
his body blocks me   i only want to infect  meet the real you 
one street with two names  runs through the city center  end racism now 
deleted the app  will get no more messages  from him the big jerk 
the only thing left  is the music we both shared  goodbye skinny love 
on lazy days off  the slow turning of a leaf  from green into brown 
initials on trees  inside of imperfect hearts  but that's what love is 
i love pikachu  pikachu throws thunderbolts  be my pokemon 
i am so angry   this cheap mouthwash has left me   foaming at the mouth 
robbed of life and growth  the wood violet gasps for air  seven breaths now dead 
weather torrid waves  swimming with mortality  freedom stillness comes 
i'm losing myself  alcohol makes me rethink  what do i feel now 
i presumed them slow  but over time i have learned  we walk unlike paths 
each moment surprise  time slips by and you fill it  perfect is your love 
innocence tainted  alone in the tomb of thought  preoccupation 
a blooming field  brimming with colours with life  battle once raged here 
i get knocked down but  i get up again never  gonna keep me down 
alone in my mind  my thoughts my thoughts my thoughts sh oot  my mind needs be shut 
and then it hit me  awful is the best there is  also a bullet 
bright sparks everywhere  kindled passion for burning  ablaze so vibrant 
a founding father  invented the lightning rod  and bifocals too 
she left on our vows  our wedding has been postponed  indefinitely 
you ended your life   i never even met you   now i deal with it 
needle to the groove   wheel of time keeps on spinning   song of life sings on 
a yearly review  wtf was i doing  living a nightmare 
a lonely petal  fluttering through the city  coloring the sky 
adulthood engaged  childhood receded quickly  such was a tough time 
over a light fire  i dry my cheek of white tears  losing part of you 
don't fucking text her   i mean it do not text her   fuck i texted her 
you will never know  the depth and breadth of the mark  you leave behind you 
bounded by myself  been in prison for too long  what to do once free 
to do or not to  to be or to not to be  that is the question 
outside sickness spreads   you in your home me in mine   we connect through screens 
big buck is my name   and deer hunter is my game   lend me a quarter 
control comes within  restrain the raging malice  of young year's yearnings 
sometimes i daydream  of the man i thought i'd be  it's very foolish 
some crow's mistake  in the backyard  a small silver frog appears 
anger raging fire  stoked by feelings unresolved  burns all in its wake 
i retained a dream  many years of forgetting  hope for a replay 
such perfect weather  thank you lord for this moment  a glimpse of heaven 
you're out protesting  over paint and your dark roots  count me out of it 
locked up and retained  a treasure long forgotten   i hope to be freed 
she danced like water  clear wild and timeless weaving  through the rugged earth 
coronavirus   nature's callous mighty yawn   i must shave today 
desert sun shower  droplets of rain dust glint from  mountain mahogany 
so why call my name   when i was the happiest  loner of us all 
we too would see far  if on giants' shoulders stood  but we bear their soles 
our time together  while it ended horribly  miss you everyday 
no haikus exist   about tiger king till now   this had to be fixed 
eyes gaze up at me  his fingers about my hair  so we are in dreams 
cacoon split apart  complete metamorphosis  butterfly takes flight 
a year full of change  the good the bad the ugly  two thousand twenty 
dandelion clocks  faded tattoos and sweet tea  i still remember 
the cardinals are here  groundhog shadow  or not 
multiverse sooths me  always better always worse  gives me perspective 
haunted moon thoughtless  a roiling stream snowflakes fall  continues never 
familiar words  unaware it chatters by  a secret message 
push ups sit ups squats  no machines no weights no friends   just isolation 
a corpse on the floor  self inflicted bullet wound  this is a protest 
green leaf in the sun   the bumblebee buzzes in   six legs feel the rest 
pushing not working  tugged a certain direction  pulled to destiny 
a small fishing boat  sways and swerves on the grim song  of father ocean 
losses unending   homesick without knowledge   can home be found yet 
brushing ash off bone  half men crawl though bitter fields  glory be the light 
today is monday  i will be counting numbers  the same on tuesday 
i miss my best friend  need to hear your voice again  give my life for yours 
my birth was abrupt  even at sea snow will fall  if the time is ripe 
mind stuck in the clouds   shy and lonely as i breathe   heart cold as first snow 
the dark closes in   enveloping the world in   a blanket of peace 
searching in the dark  yearning for lost connections  my lonely bluetooth 
i thought it was grass   but today ah white flowers   what else need i know 
all i love will die  i will become old and poor  and then i'll be gone 
i've lied to myself   so i make this pledge to truth   later begins now 
such magnanimous talent  stifled by dogma  imposed to enable 
a country so small  full of beauty and wonder  i am in heaven 
if i know nothing   but perhaps nothing make sense   so i know the sense 
a shell of blankets  keep me warm in the autumn  another cold day 
a sole rubber ball  bouncing through the bright meadow  a boing a smile 
chilled winds of winter  red leaf blown through air then stops  an entire life 
the rape of nanking   not a subject you see much   in this kind of poem 
no tinder no more  no more loneliness in store  no storms anymore 
how perfect your word  you are the way truth and life  lambwe follow you 
coffee at midnight   no wonder i'm lacking sleep   fill me with regret 
when i close my eyes  i can pretend i'm with her  the girl of my dreams 
oh little flower  lift your head now open up  time for you to bloom 
mosquitoes buzz near  sticky red popsicle hands  tasty summer treat 
on the first thursday  of each month in the summer  they have free concerts 
he wants a wall built  purportedly for defense  but that makes no sense 
yaah it's rewind time  if i could control rewind  i would want fortnite 
four folds and tidy  stacking squares and filling up  flush top unkempt hair 
cyber surrendings  the pain is real  artificial loneliness 
sickness in the air  i have nowhere i can fly  so please clip these wings 
no my good preacher  i am not that desperate  i believe in death 
could have would have all  but no desire to persist  outcome is nothing 
fallen leaves red brown  mini tornadoes rise up  chills face and warms soul 
mass  shooting  stars 
romantic ideas  minimal words telling all  lost in translation 
he walks through a field  lighter than a butterfly  and the world trembles 
anticipation  we're alone on the night beach  to realize this kiss 
my birthday is close  thank you for being my mom  i miss your meatloaf 
was there no sentence  no words i could rearrange  nothing to save you 
look a petal falls  from the flowers you gave me  as they slowly die 
bowing to power  unconscious crowd of pretence  how ridiculous 
tasteless spaghetti  is it olive garden or  coronavirus 
i am filled with rage   everything is maddening   i cannot go on 
clouds in autumn skies  drift like my sense of purpose  i am fucking bored 
don't pick up that bag  it's contents won'tregister  until it's picked up 
i have to tell you  a secret unknown to man  i still do love you 
become who you are  for you do not need to change  but accept yourself 
stardust formations  from infinite directions  view centers briefly 
summertime dreaming  remembercelebrate now  a taste of heaven 
cherry blossoms dance  a fleeting touch and sparks  fuelled by inner strength 
funny how we crossed paths  the second i stopped searching  finally at home 
the you that you lit  illuminated my world  if only briefly 
falling quickly down  holds an unquestionable  submerging comfort 
the weeping roses  conceal their beauty from light  not six feet apart 
mother earth is  just showing off how great   she is without us 
watermelon seeds  become childhood projectiles  produced from produce 
together again   i swore i heard you saying  the alarm bell rings 
twenty seventeen  sexual harassment meet  karma enough said 
i did not know then  this ugly wrapping paper  would last for ten years 
amber horizon   the lone swallow carves her path   refusing to fail 
self healing takes time  learning and unlearning roles  much needed retreat 
pop the molly yes   heart beats inside of my chest   this feeling the best 
i awoke alive  yet absorbed with tiny things  wrens chirp in winter 
rapid volley now  worthy adversary found   ball swift as the wind 
travelling homewards  my being could not refuse  the pavement's embrace 
pick up the pieces  put the puzzle together  i am incomplete 
wool over closed eyes  take off the sweaty blind fold  i'm still not looking 
learning asl  deaf client in my office  understands my signs 
warmth and sunlight  dark clouds slowly encroaching   now i am ready 
sol de verano   de un gigante al oeste   vese mi sombra 
this is a haiku  it follows haiku conventions  i hope you like it 
acorn drops from tree  but trees can not produce corn  i am amazed 
liquid fire  red sights and irony taste  waits the icy blade 
when we know ourselves  the world is for our taking  live your potential 
tears have all been spent  so the heavens cry for me   raindrops burn my cheeks 
you're thrown to the wolves  i'm bored of ultra violence  deaths angel rises 
signing lullabies  i wish for some sleep this night  yet it's four am 
this is the first spring  that i have looked forward to  all because of you 
i pen down my thoughts   pour all my emotions in   then i turn the page 
as buddha nature  is an inherent constant  limitless as sky 
five syllables here   seven syllables right here   and there's five more here 
he who gave me life  hath returned to the cold ground   was it all my fault 
anorexia  starving for more than just food  a sense of purpose 
got a twist of cain   yeah it's just driving my brain   from the god below 
engaged for rapture  silent pray'rs on broken knees  let it be tonight 
if the buddha laughs  is he really the buddha  the laugh goes silent 
have lived so many  lives in my mind the real world  no longer makes sense 
people gossiping  to feel good about themselves  truly disgusting 
candles flickering  night falls upon the city  the waiter arrives 
your words to your loves  only with grace can i speak  tears of joy follow 
too much caution   can likely be a danger   act responsibly 
i did not date him  his hair was very pretty  prettier than mine 
always do you knock  when i answer you change me  please come and stay 
dozing by the fire  careworn old friend on my lap  purs that heal us both 
tolerance abound  all people and things welcome  except for lactose 
i just want to die  my lust for life wont oblige  they call this living 
withering dying   winter has come to destroy   helplessly i wait 
celebrate what is  do not mourn for what is not  otherwisesuffer 
entangled desires  deceptive misdirections  the games we do play 
morning kiss goodbye  a fresh coffee warms my hands  cat prints on my car 
the shifting shadows  are coming for those you love  let's both protect them 
schizo friend in ya  sounds scary but it's our capes   we hated heroes 
laguna beach days  exotic dreamlike waters  picturesque sunsets 
damn what is that song  its on the tip of my tongue  oh shit wait it's gone 
testing my resolve  transition takes me by storm  what is the real world 
the end of summer  hesitant release of hand  first time taking bus 
i am sad inside  yet i still tend to smile  to keep them happy 
transitional states  think of them as a cocoon  emerge and fly high 
little ketchup bags   lying huddled on the counter  unused unwanted 
using microscope   regard the mini world   magnification

this thanksgiving day  don't say grace for what you have  think of the have nots 
leaves snap like flags  memories of winter wind  the sweat on my face 
why yes i believe  aliens contacted me  gave me news to share 
step into darkness  embrace an impulsive gut  trust brings clarity 
the end of limbo  return to reality  might almost be safe 
the past may tempt you  to dwell in and feel regret  you got your karma 
i love you so much  that i would endure burning  just to be your light 
we are not alone  we are the whole universe  it listens to us 
we are all broken   shattered pieces everywhere   glistening in light 
the wind is still now  winter water drifts slowly  piling up silence 
he's a foolish man  who fells a beautiful tree  just to count its rings 
three months left to live  one last trip to eat his pancakes  shirt soaked with her tears 
purpose singular  the blossom spreads her petals  the bees ignore her 
the rules are simple   stay away from the real world   protect the future 
my dreams disturb me  even the beautiful ones  they fuck with my head 
some stuck in peru   some are stuck in morocco   they want to go home 
i wish this sub had  a glossary of haiku  linked from the sidebar 
inspiration grows  until bursting at the seams  infinity plus

good morning my dear  the clouds will make a great frame  for your lovely smile 
strength is wearing thin  your touch your smell your smile  harder to say no 
songbird perched on a branch  fresh snow falls  melts on warm cheeks 
i live a lame life  one who's meaning has been lost  i hope it ends soon 
hand myself over  to where tunes are regular  interesting life 
the grass grows taller   we are born we live we die   and the grass gets cut 
a haiku for lost   souls if you dont know what to   do do the dishes 
a badge of brutal  blue curtains are drawn on the  police behavior 
the unseen human  they remain invisible  no matter what clothes they wear 
bored of qurantine   i cant wait to go outside   when will that day come 
writing a paper  i'm still procrastinating  on reddit four hours 
cracked skin strums the steel  freeing tunes you held for long  brings you rhythmic joy 
three in the morning  droning traffic pollution  versus the night sounds 
no one hears you yell  deep within the void of space  we are abandoned 
sometimes you need it  melancholy and slower  just a song sung blue 
i breath a small cloud  in space it hangs keeping shape  no breeze to stir it 
love you mary jane  you are my favorite thing  fuck baby yoda 
it's ma'am you bigot  dude i'm mental over here  change your norms for me

stay strong this will end  mentally physically  it's in you to persevere 
poignant memories  sadden me with happiness  from long long ago 
morality there  is no good or bad there is  only is or isn't 
the clouds cast shadows   in the garden where we danced   when i think of you 
this morning i heard   your song your voice in my head   a broken record 
scrub til hands are raw  isopropyl keys and phone  this is normal now 
running on the edge  falling for an empty page  down in history 
across wintry rocks  froze in a heartbeats distance  a stag's crow eyes flare 
summer is ending  like dandelions in the  wind we drift away 
many rows of teeth   great hunters of the ocean   sharks are very cool 
i did a haiku  five syllables on my hand  then seven then five 
twenty four hours  nicotine withdrawal pains  i have just begun 
like hands of a child  tiny tracks in the first snow  looking for a snack 
words have such power   one can condense the cosmos   into a haiku 
so hard forgiveness  so closejust a step to start  so precious your grace 
there will come a day  when the last bridge collapses  yet the river flows 
cornerstone for me  bricks laid on such perfection  continuing the pilgrimage 
a student bends low  cherry blossoms overhead  penny on the ground 
sometimes these are fun  sometimes they hit close to home  toaster next to tub 
ligh the dry matchstick to ash  look up and wonder  where did all the green trees go 
lesser fear of sharks   graceful creatures of the deep   you have my respect 
worn like an old wheel  rolls along like a river  but seldom it roars 
spring and the past life  a forest of memories  an endless cycle 
goblins in my skin  haiku so hard it hurts me  i cried and wrote this 
the lineman hooked a  rope and hung by a thread to  repair his webbing 
on nights like tonight  loneliness crowds in so close  wish you felt the same 
crimson red above   bitter sting to your nostrils   all hope is restored 
slowly undressing  pretty garments falling down  just a stem remains 
ocean swells fiercely  waves crashing against the cliffs  the cliffs cannot last 
potato tacos  a tasty and filling lunch  i want a repeat 
listen with intent   to sounds between the silence   melody is born 
the unknown scares me   no way to truly prepare  that's why death scares me 
i have a good boy  i wish he was still with me  i miss my good boy 
an empty haiku  short and incomplete story  writen without care 
night time is lonely   lost calls from a duck in spring  his wife has been caught 
dreams are shy creatures  the morning call is dreadful  one more minute please 
scraps of burnt paper  swallowed by eddies and waves  our marriage undone 
rainy mountain path  travelled by all in their life  home lays at its end 
i may not wait more   pressing deadline due right now   hurry up and eat 
under the silk sheets  where our bodies first met now  lie past memories 
windshield wipers strain  to clear my view but the storm  is on the inside 
sharp intake of breath  eyes wild like a rearing horse  who canceled netflix 
rhythm and meter  grace and strength given to those  who prefer neither 
ponytail holders  sitting in the summer sun  why do i do this 
i am a treasure  in an ocean of treasures  swimming steadily 
refrigerator  switch freon with gasoline  incinerator 
pale grasses  blushing pink  february dawn 
at the men's sauna  be my homosexual  just don't tell my wife 
words don't seem to work  so many things to tell you  limited by speech 
bloody and pregnant  her rape kit helps the police  reunite them all 
sleazy greasy boss   human resource department   stay in the closet 
here is a candle  a slice of sweetness and light  let the flame linger 
a butterfly bounced  across the field in front of  net and running boy 
heavy is the heart  when i gift you roses  that you cannot smell 
money get away  you get a good job with more  pay and you're okay 
repeating heartbeats   within a tepid pillow   pressed by heft of time 
gold medal efforts  still the consolation prize  but this she is not 
i'm no beach goer  but i'll go to obx  for biscuits and porn

willful ignorance  will always be more toxic  than just plain stupid 
an exceptional  lover and my closest friend  is now evicted 
astral planes though i  know them not are all around  us in dream and thought 
a somber gray sky  rain lightly taps on the roof  slowly falling down 
these fluorescent lights  inspiring bugs in flight  silent stars above 
i like to write raps  marathon of words running  some syllable laps 
essential worker  constantly facing danger  still they soldier on 
a flick of the thumb  the hard truth is avoided  oh look a puppy 
walking through the woods   the wind breathes into my lungs   the friendly north wind 
lord open my lips  so that my mouth may proclaim  all my praise for you 
searching for sharp things  worn down devoid of fuck it  the grind left me dull 
a jay broken winged  hops around the yard for food  while i count my days 
now i'm running late  i even woke up early  procrastination 
fabricating me  robotic man brought to life  next evolution 
see the light dusting  nature's frosting on a cake  snow on the hills 
sparkling water  matches your sparkling fur  shedded on my shirt 
they protect me from  prying eyes suspicious glares  my shower curtains 
canine citizens  paw populace with leashes  slung over hydrants 
skimming stones on rain  falling brief as phases go  puddles fade by day 
delicious sushi  i dip you in wasabi  my belly thanks you 
my head on a stick  carried through our city streets  heralded failure 
tits or ass he asked   i looked at him with disgust   thighs is the answer 
the ground's eyes open   she shakes off her heavy coat   and fills her lungs deep 
woke up sick today  tomorrow i'll quit drinking  woke up sick today 
the storm winds blowing   our windows rattle loudly   still my children sleep 
missing you always  perpetual silence reigns  unfinished unsaid 
we can't erase it  posed for a somber photo  grey washed with sorrow 
what game should we play  cards against humanity   we're going to hell 
words yield great power  one can condense the cosmos  into a haiku 
like a blunt pencil  i need you to sharpen me  but the lead shatters 
feel the burning sun  smell the hot frangipani  taste the trickling sweat 
try to be yourself  i advise them not knowing  what a mirror is 
keep your eyes covered  my mother's comforting voice  shrieks but i don't peek 
at times nothin works  everything that can goes wrong  i dream of the end 
today was special   it was time to level up   someday i may win 
serial killer    of conversations friendships    and relationships 
we know so many  different faces of friends  yet we know little 
the rain hurts my heart   let me see my beautiful   my darling sunshine 
who's ready to teach  how it's done is up to you  your pedagogy 
such a young life  but does it belong to me  what i call my own 
whispers fade alive  a wolf calls out haunted moon  menacing midnight

life can be so hard  every step gets easier  with your hand in mine 
a whiskey laced dawn  where dogs run mad with lost love  i sit rose in hand 
tequila sunrise   red orange yellow ice cold   i need another 
dead trees wish to bloom  tulips lay at your tombstone   memories blossom 
at the register  threats exhale too close to me  masked identities 
the morningstar dared  so he was cast down burning   to weep in absence 
hometown funeral  driving back a railroad wreck  something in common 
words hold no meaning  your true intentions shine through  showing who you are

rain on the window  leaves swaying in the cold wind  thoughts of you unasked 
weather rules this day  breath cold seek warmth a hug please  love will get us through 
let's go on a date  we can eat grass and pretend  that we're cows in love 
travel to future  what will happen tomorrow  i can know it now 
it's so hot today  writing haikus didn't help  i've got a headache 
i wish i could fly   i'm not made of gasoline   or toll booth money 
my only desire  to mend harm and suffering  selfless compassion 
bright smile teary eyes  she wears the same mask daily  she'll get over it 
she didn't want kids  took all the right precautions  and then she bore twins 
leaves hold on no more  the winds want to set you free  take courage and fly 
cute little bubble  dancing through the air bliss feels  oh wait pop the end 
maybe a bird is  wandering in far vision  looking for it's prey 
every year we pass  through the anniversary  of our future death 
flame over flower  whistling inhalation  hallucinations 
why do i feel bad  butterflies in my stomach  stress over nothing 
a single leaf adds  to the mass very good mulch  for a hungry earth 
it was never me  the excuses that i made  not to live my life 
hardcore cuddling  the best way to start the day  thank you canine friends 
flower in a fist  feel it crunch and pop and bleed  choked by broken stem 
we need to stop this   making the second guessing   and stop from being so nervous 
much cold little light  warmth life found in your embrace  seasons we journey 
voices in the night  can they hear us too silence  quick get behind me 
tremendous pressure  the spark of rebellion  stoked by the righteous 
hamburger helper   no one ate it for dinner   my head hangs in shame 
wolf helplessly howls   for his kin will have vanished   in a moon's time 
the phone rang six times  hello she whispered still hoarse  only heard his breath 
you make my knees weak   your passion swallows me whole  i give in to you 
road curving ahead  considering my options  could keep going straight 
wanna hear something  no listen no listen hey  i'm not obnoxious 
on my side of town  the rain never seems to stop  even with no clouds 
narrow wildcat streets  a trained specialist lurches  enjoying the spawn 
treacherous mountain  euphoric and troublesome  new paramedic 
i saw her face here   looking out over the sea   then i fell in love 
time to say sorry  to pause before i react  renew everything 
crisp bubbles rising  golden hues glimmering bright  the smell of fresh hops 
here comes our bright star  we are waiting for its light  fear it but fear not 
cold ferocious winds  they break the silence of night  nature's warning voice 
i broke that birdbath   for you because i knew how   much you hated it 
decadent madness   i lie awake in the night   confounded by it 
with the headphones on  he watch tongues flap in the wind  like archaic flags 
you a wilted rose  strikingand in need of love  i shall be your sun 
my palate transformed  scorched ships crashed on the sea shore  islay scotch whisky 
mittens are mugging  a handle on skating with  floating marshmallows 
early morning gym   sweating pushing breathing hard   what the utter fuck 
a happy bottom   reaches high into the air  and lets out a fart 
tan granules expand  to deep blue icy ripples   my sanctuary 
past smiles in our wake  obliged to forlorn future  i languish betwixt 
long i wait for god  i slip into oblivion  still i yearn for love 
tear down lennon wall  those patriotic students  only wear supreme 
the seconds tick by  every one a reminder  she never called back 
the warmth of his skin  supple with each conscious touch  widens pleasantly 
what it is to be  folded wings of a sparrow  an unpicked apple 
i want to be yours  put your head on my shoulder  tell me you love me 
there's nothing sweeter  than having the taste of you  stained upon my lips 
dry country prevails  the drought years of history  threaten to return 
happy drinkers crowd  autumn european streets  carelessly strolling 
i am so damn bored  i am so damn bored in fact  i wrote a haiku 
democracy brings  a sucullent chinese meal  well how about that

anglers wading through  melting snow carves the mountain  rivers born anew 
the butterfly nest  lying in the abdomen  has withered away 
i'm feeling anxious  i don't know how it will go  it can go any way 
oh what a surprise   our desires are misaligned  so i go without 
no need to oppress  my depressor works just fine  downward i begin 
a lonesome spirit  all must return home sometime  where even is that 
fifteen minutes could  save fifteen percent or more  on car insurance 
in her eyes on snow  the wind takes words a blown kiss  mocking bird forlorn 
with a poor man's clothes  or the richest in the world  i remain myself 
simmering blue dawn   rain slicks my skin   walking to work 
don't fear unknown  walk out into the darkness  your eyes will adjust

drowning sun  restless eyelid  rising moon 
flapjacks bacon eggs  that is my breakfast today  washed down with coffee 
this pulse between us  alluring and electric  we must never touch 
many months no pants  the zipper and i struggle  against each other 
wild bird you teach me  to hold out my open hand  but not wait for you 
a ramparted heart  past pains proverbial walls  vigilant to all 
infinity war  spoilers are everywhere  please be cautious 
disappointment yes  is my joy diminished no  driven by my goal 
it sure would be nice  if everyone stopped lying  and told me the truth 
the river flows to  the sea would that it  would carry me thus 
this hole in my chest  needs to be filled with something  maybe money will work 
if you are lonely  just remember this haiku  and i'm there with you 
found yourself falling   because there were hints of care   imagination 
will you follow me   to the depths of the dark sea   just to breathe for me 
emotional but  nowhere to express myself  except for online 
chasing my losses  i know i can win it back  casino blackjack

child of farting   please do not throw up on me   drink your mothers milk 
used to know you like   the back of my hand now you're   just a phantom limb 
today's my birthday  death slides one more stone across   on his abacus 
shampoo scent adorns   i recount another time   gumption and sweat soaked 
milk fresh from the cow  delivered quickly to me  just boil it and drink 
carrots and hummus  such delightful snack buddies  i am become death 
i cannot be more  than the sum of my old parts  please believe i am 
this wooden heart swells  meant to hold her lovely soul  when it does it burns 
i love overwatch  its competitive game mode  is quite frustrating 
a dusty old gi  what stories could you tell of  failure and success 
i like to suck toes   i like the smell of old socks   hit me up ladies 
the cold wind gently  caresses long hair in my  own cigarette smoke 
crunching underfoot  ah that missing frito  where's the broom and pan 
dog toys on the floor  a deadly trap in the night  falling unaware 
my head was fuzzy  i could not think properly  anxiety leave 
lungs full of fresh air  the dandelion wishes  dancing on the breeze 
abuse of power  can be done in many ways  by sharpie or tweet 
like the snow that fell   this place was once unblemished   now just sludge remains 
a dream about you  changed nothing and leaving me  somehow emptier 
got to make some green   this damn hunger is torment   my lust is not cheap 
for someone like me  who always picks at her wounds  i will never heal 
love is not for all  but all seek it in the end  begging all for more 
i am an odd man  but i like most other folk  only need respect 
pipes bridging a gap  currents that once pushed and pulled  closed valves cutting flow 
the thing about it is   i will always hold my breath   when i see your name 
fall is more than leaves   its a sneeze in the breeze and   bees in apple trees 
i tried to forget   only to remember you again   and rob myself of sleep 
emotion sickness  loneliness sadness and fear  alone sad and scared 
so many choices  some right others wronghindsight  best with your grace lord 
wisteria blooms  gentle violet ladders fall to earth  from heaven 
colorful insects  reflect the spectrum of light  eyes seeing wonder 
these words i plucked straight   from the indian summer  you left in my heart 
wendy peffercorn   he jumped in and almost drowned   all for just one kiss 
exorcise evil  before i get consumed whole  silence then pitch black 
let's boil em up and  serve em on a trashcan lid  crawfish boil 
drinking and smoking  bury my heart six feet deep  let time fill the hole 
the mighty king   ruler of the vast jungle   in the sea just sinks 
trees silently stand  counting the rings of our times  leaves record the song 
oh heavenly father  on a thrown of worldly sin  how does it feel 
lost under the night  a roaring plane passes by  ink smudges her lips 
if we had the time  to pursue our real passions  we would squander it 
warm air gentle breeze  sensing love surrounding me  how blessed are we all 
is my cup now full  perhaps it is now empty  still it pulls my hand 
mind of the buddha   without beginning or end  becomes like the sky 
i orbit the sun  today the twenty ninth times  hope peace and blessings 
hard to get  is a strong game  for a while 
thank you kind stranger  for letting me cut in line  this haikus for you 
wander to the beach  gaze out into the ocean  what is my purpose 
i hate that feeling   a night of festivity   that i turned to sleep 
life is a mere joke  too far from being funny  we all feign laughter 
heating cold pizza  the cheese bubbles once again  lava on my tongue 
poetry is hard  but haiku is so easy  any moron who can count can do it 
smelly laundry  attack of bugs and spiders  glorified summer 
i cannot create    a verse worthy for you so    all my words are yours 
no need of compass  on my way to you  the moon is enough 
auburn coloured clouds   do their best to hide the sun   yet it waves goodbye 
left right left right left  what is the correct approach  there's no point in love 
protests erupting  there is no virus like man  autumn may bring hope 
the sun keeps rising  to teach us the meaning  of road slush and red lights 
the windy section  conducted by the maestro  to blow in the march 
the tree is growing  no matter how big or small  it may need support 
seen through the window  tall buildings of glass and steel   a leaf floating by 
oh what a pleasure  to see trees lining my path  of discovery 
the quiet rainfall  washes away dried cold sweat  from the night before 
distant music hums  echoes rhythmic solitude  time and space muted 
he used to do a job   got dissatisfied and became his own boss   the hypocrite now dissatisfies others 
country on fire   merciless flames devour all   life reduced to ash 
her step deft and quick  she always danced best alone  in her own spotlight 
quietly she rose  the moon is a harsh mistress  it's hard to let go 
a fleeting moment  finding me lost in nature  eternal oneness 
everytime you poop   a frog breaches the water   a piece of you gone 
wind is nudging the  conifer conversation  whispering to sky 
she curled up into  a ball hoping to drown out  the sound of the city 
flailing arms my wings  knocked from the top step i soared  head first to the floor 
the snow has fallen  my broken mind grows colder  the depth of winter 
ego deferred when the  glacier weeps to quench all of  earth's thirst that is love 
'nother day passing  my passions slowly dying  a dull life tiring 
how can i let go   when all of my waking thoughts   long for one more dream 
decrying borders  only passed by a crossing  this ghastly nation 
salmon sky dark clouds  in warmth i watch the sunset  this train wobbles south 
hot wings are the best  spicy so my lips swollen  no ranch for me please 
our eyes met today  i finally walked over   and i said hello 
are you all i need  i don't know how much you care  if you care at all 
twenty four frames  a second still not enough  pictures of you 
reborn once a year  a phoenix from mush not ash  the snowman stands tall 
chilling at my house   answer door they run away   forgot i was nude 
seeds planted in spring   slumbering through the winter   sprouting in the spring 
all life lives scantly  from this we must deviate  live upon the dash 
slippery road  the taxicab skidded  i saw my temple 
time is a construct  created by man and my  receding hair line 
your hero will fail  your star will shatter and fall  i will laugh longest 
i may be forty  but when snow begins to fall  i feel five again 
leaves fall and crumble  in endless cycles of gifts  death hopes life will use 
growing apart us  we live together alone  how long til this ends 
down under the dirt  they crawl and fight to survive  they will soon find life 
it's funny that i can simultaneously dread  an outcome while also wishing for it  as to just end the anxiety 
thank you reddit friends  always afraid to be heard  but here i feel safe 
she calls above me  ringing throughout this valley  she sings of my home 
i love overwatch  its competitive game mode   is quite frustrating 
bright yellow sunlight  falls through the green canopy  of the great oak tree 
what scares me the most  has brought me to my new home  we all float down here 
morning gusts through peaks  the awakened dragon roars  please pardon my fart 
did not lose my mind  when nature of nature changed  just revealed the lies 
love are you and i  can you see it believe it  live it for joy peace 
my ex cut herself  i did not tell anyone  now i blame myself 
water emerges  forming to a perfect drop  moving till it leaves 
a sword cannot cut  the vows we have made or the  memories we share 
feeling nostalgic  for a time that never was  and never will be 
things will never change  if i sit around all night  eating hershey's bars 
quality content  give only a few upvotes  cats give too many 
when prayer released  when in silence a tear forms  there i find my love 
meeting on the field  a fox spiritcomes along  winter is coming 
i see words within  black strokes dance around white space  and so it is born 
smog clouds rain acid  plastic strangles the ocean  convenience is god 
the top of your head   passes a tiny window   i watch miles away 
under the lightless night  a new flower blooms  will be first will it be last 
best days passed quickly  my dreams devoured by time  the end seemed so far 
goodbye fat man jeans  your seams i've worn thin now split  my love has killed you 
valley of my heart  river of my memory  settles me at night 
my stomach it growls  outside it snows with the owls  i will have a soup 
the sun on your face  was a sign from the cosmos  that my search was over 
been to vermont once  yes i had ben and jerry's  i'd like to go back 
found cupid's arrows  struck two in my empty heart  i need to love me 
everyday i work  waiting for my life to start  maybe tomorrow 
weekend laundry like  i will feel so accomplished  but did not do much 
servants are we friend  do you hear the call answer  serve with love and joy 
rain pounds the mountain  two lovers dance in the mists  cold but warm embrace 
her face to the storm  unfazed by the lashing rain  her will is greater 
while the sun is out  shadows on the church clock face  try to mislead me 
the song bird sits still  ready for the leap forward  fear is always there 
disturbance of steel  white wings silently evade  unbound by cold law 
sleepless night  stray cat getting fucked outside  please help oh my god 
strictly that moment  a relative hour or two  sunrise tomorrow 
decision broken   so effortlessly yielding   it was expected 
eyes awake always  the worst mistress cheats me still  sleep stays so distant 
scent of clovers here  just another instrument  nature's symphony 
this world is just noise  life has become alien  love is all that's clear 
as the light breaks through  i understand happiness  the dog wags its tail 
how imature these  little leaves are but perfect  for a fresh mint tea 
boolprop testingcheats  enabled true motherlode  motherlode copy paste 
deployed for battle  sabotaging hatred and  trenching flags in peace 
patrolling the sea  floating so majestically  a rubber ducky 
vocabulary  a fickle commodity  compound interest 
whilst we lounge indoors   spring the sullen beauty queen   grows irritable 
a light in the night  makes me pine for life before  chick fil a billboards 
born of ol' brimstone  engulfed in flames of sorrow  return to ashen refuge 
heavy eyes so wide  wishing to sleep for the night  awake by phone light 
fumbling through my life  my skills the skills of others  me the imposter 
please listen to me  let me be clear of fake sins  i'm misunderstood 
wood pigeon nest  in a bundle of clothes  my sleeping daughter 
why can't you listen  this could've been easier  now it is too late 
the leaves soaked you up  your night sky so far from mine  return to the dust 
my warmth touches you  it's what you've been waiting for  satisfies your needs 
yearning for closeness  as i battle loneliness  i need privacy 
when you disappeared   i never thought addiction   i am so sorry 
a caterpillar  may become a butterfly  or an ugly moth 
hanging by a string  i must surrender myself  to the darker things 
candy and coffee  that's how i start my mornings  bachelorhood is great 
green valley below  blue sky white clouds yellow sun  a single bird sings 
hurried and awkward  swirling tongues not soon enough  that was my first kiss 
the contents of this   is deciding my future   two page resume 
taking respite in   a bath for birds the hunter   floats distractedly 
trying to progress   the misery continues   the job search goes on 
here i lie crying  alone as per usual  my tears are hidden 
deep rumbling wakes me   when trains boom across the bridge   while passengers sleep 
red yellow and orange   smell of leaves and fire wood   fall is my favorite 
a fresh morning breeze  blows green leaves in trees  kites against blue skies 
a wintry breeze blows  barren maples slowly sway  chocolate eyes warm 
to rise peacefully  and descend into silence  the way of the world 
peering through closed blinds  the trill of an unknown bird  delays my mourning 
dreams aside i live  like animals i roam free  darkness evades me 
i like you like that  all wrapped around my finger  manipulation 
crisp and muted woods  the trees hush as i approach  just to go unnoticed 
what lasts forever  pluto's ice mercury's fire  can no season be 
looking at memes   oh look another spaceman   he amogus sus 
lost in reverie  constellations wheel above  moonlit augury 
clarke is wanheda  lexa leads coalition  all seek unity 
masters of failure  slaves to success  submit in order to dominate 
careless moths she there  their desire for her lit  not burning she did 
riding the white slopes   nudle dick and glassy eyes  need to get some sleep 
beyond the valley  my promised future awaits  yet i venture not 
the way uncertain  in the middle of this road  i don't want to die 
sorrow in winter  melts away as spring begins  ready for rebirth 
heat of the moment  angry flaming breath backfired  self immolation 
day like a water   swiftly pouring through my palms   and dust becomes dirt 
if i live in fear  every second of every day  then i must be brave 
fall asleep alone  to dream depict i wonder  if i'll ever change 
dwelling on the past  will just delay your future  keep moving forward 
i came to you soaked   i was expecting nothing   you were my towel 
i wish i cared less   i wish that i could forget   a spotless sunshine 
lazy poetry  doesn't have to rhyme at all  some punctuation 
distant times draw near  cloudy skies and under earth  mortality comes

burn january  a former tall bruce reza  despite the bruser 
lights finally out  cross yourself slide down the wall  your hellion slumbers 
hot lifeless desert  looking for four leaf clovers  finding happiness 
all i see is light  all i hear is shrieking wheels  then all is no more 
why inspiration   i reserved us a table   but you stood me up 
when society  tells you the way to feel joy  it commonly lies 
an unknown abyss   less explored than our own moon   a nightmare below 
found a new hobby  improving my haïku skills  more is yet to come

as summer ends  the shades project their shadows  warmth's comforting 
i cut down the wood  i got splinters on my hands  this house is a home 
the stinging is fine  we must make friends with the pain  and fight through today

i just had it here  but it decided to leave  where is my damn pen 
too many ideas  procrastination present  motivation gone 
alas the peak  now to enjoy the descent  celebrate the finish 
the lack of sleep peels  layers of your mind away  raw subconscious thoughts 
eyes open slowly  a vague form lays beside me  where now are my pants 
here is a good one  longer than it ought to be  monosyllabic 
sanguine afternoons  pass like trees on the highway  nights like the mountains 
we are each unique  but not just anyone can  make us feel special 
london suburbs  fog fog enveloping the town  intimate mornings 
dragonfly sunbathes  petaled wings blooming fingers  pluck air in presage 
dragging feet through haze   musing if the tempest will halt  i hope spring shows up 
dressed in hoodies i   go to the wardrobe to stroke   my normal clothes soon 
many paths ahead  yet my feet take me nowhere  always uncertain 
writer writes some words   dance of syllables goes on   meaning never sure 
dogs should get married  canines in matrimony  not just puppy love 
display true honor  place your sword upon the leaves  feed your family 
an early morning  thunderstorm lashing city  who wanted more sleep 
people tap their feet  the line grows even longer  forgot my wallet 
a glass of wine is   a poem itself the last   sip is another 
love is a calm sea  unmoved by the rushing wind  thoughts become silence 
the stereos blare  wailing auditory waste  poison's terrible 
at the grand canyon  truly a sight to behold  it goes on for miles 
a strange toad licked me  i licked the strange toad right back  and now i see things 
an ocean of shale  couldn't keep lovers apart  weeds reach for the sun 
plunging the toilet  doing cpr on it  so now it can flush 
i wish you were here   i want to make you happy   but i don't know how 
i say when we sell  ten million is the floor  apes love diamond hands 
traces of lovers  linger in scent and on skin  your heart left untouched 
problems block my path  but like yesterday i say  maybe tomorrow 
five o'clock whistle  a rainbow fades away between  the neighbors' chimneys 
thunder bee  hurting and scary  soothes sweetly 
i know its a trick  i'll play along morning sun   i know you will leave 
the cave at the beach  pulls in the cold winter sea  where last spring i posed 
maskless in the store  just raw doggin oxygen  i feel like a slut 
looking for the words  in the bosom of the fire  waning crescent moon 
synthetic kinship  reasonably priced pleasure  not quite ecstasy 
bittersweet ending  love earned through a hard fight lost  you're crying not me 
my mind swirls her scent  visions and dreams commence  my heart is captured 
standing back to back  guarding against the wild world  what lurks between us 
up anchor set sail  bow to forces underway  stern words for all men 
do you ever wonder  which christmas  will be your last 
yes i work from home  no i don't shower daily  disgusting you bet 
hey we all make trash   but know only some of us   do recycle it 
this anxiety  goes not softly in the night  it screams and it screams 
the first of spring's rains  the first of the redbud's blooms  the first geese head north 
red covered bridges  water rushing underneath  carrying the leaves 
i am stressed and sad  why does nothing go my way  i messed up again 
winged cherubs take flight  into moonlight's hazed grandeur  numerous as stars 
this is a haiku  i didn't really try  bing bang boom goodbye 
so young yet so lost  her eye's fire once burned bright  now gone in the cold 
this day your way lord  grace empowers thoughts words deeds  overfilled with joy 
alexa's all ears  not just when you speak to her  class action lawsuit 
golden rays of sun   a lovely weaving of light   cascading about 
challenging yourself  determined to go forward  one step at a time 
today i will learn  tomorrow i will forget  sun rises anyway 
net neutrality  is going to go away  stupid fcc 
the journey begins  a grand quest to mow a lawn  one man and his bike 
sunny winter morn  melts away yesterdays fun  someone lost a glove 
harsh words burst forth pain  flashing from my heart they were  a lesson for me 
monday morning blues  another bus passes by  late to work again 
my boss pees golden  showers of wisdom we are  pissed on and pissed off 
divorce is the price  half pay so we all can dare  to believe in love 
hummers dance and whirl   just a sip sustains their speed   honeysuckle blooms 
cyclone from nowhere  with a terrifying name  bombogenesis 
buried deep within  in stillness dark lady weeps  she once had a soul 
volcanic temptress   blowing kisses of dark ash   beckon me closer 
rain wakes the dark earth  emerald blades thrusting forth  hope springs eternal 
blazing like the sun  passion reigniting my soul  purpose found again 
give thanks for today  for you can eat all you want  and not feel guilty 
in between spaces  an awareness of silence  listen in presence 
no eggs nor his hat  read across america   has cancelled the cat 
the eyes of a cat  be it love or agression  always look the same 
first time bunking class  python java script has been tough  bunking to catch up 
i am not my thoughts  in and through they come and go  but still i remain 
one should realize  that other people's progress  is not your failure 
company for mars  shades of red fill the night sky  blood moon on the rise 
suck start a shotgun  much thicker than a milkshake  a forbidden treat 
shoes tucked beneath our arms  we wade through sun steeped water  and brush against tall grass 
a few thousand bees  vomiting drops of nectar  for your banana 
smoking cigarettes  addicting and destructive  like you were to me 
my only desire  to end harm and suffering   selfless compassion 
i love you like words  want to be spoken yet still  long to be whispered 
three cold hard boulders  scuffed by wind and rain and sand  protect a tortoise 
watch the earth decline  at the point of no return  gaze new beginnings 
roses from a seed  petals flowing in the wind  beauty of flowers 
i feel tired   one after the other   at some point i'll stop 
i wish i could live   in the glimpses of myself   i saw in your eyes 
day by day you love  my lord step by step you lead  how awesome you are 
i age in mirrors  regrets and fears stir my soul  clocks never rewind 
i thought that i could haiku  seven five seven  turns out i was wrong bugger 
drifting morning fog  rivulets gather and wash  over broken trees 
said you needed space  'cause you hated the distance  now we're just distant 
democracy is  rarely practiced in lifeboats  real or imagined 
my five am tea  billowing clouds of white steam  i wait while it cools 
'round my soul a sheer  gossamer restrains all my  ambition and shame 
a drink too many  brings these feelings aplenty  must rebuild the dam 
ten cubes  five music notes  became of them 
this ain't a haiku  though it follows the format  that happened by chance 
computers for peace  application developers  declare var not war 
to consume the earth  seemed impossible until  i unhinged my jaw 
hiding the plain truth  you control the narrative  making sins vanish 
always love for us  the gifts and graces we need  each stroke perfects us 
sunshine through fog  silhouetted tree branches  long grass grey with dew 
what does not kill you  will still haunt you afterwards  but they will soon fade 
vaguely familiar  another boring birthday  not much you can do 
why has it taken  so long to do in a word  procrastination 
uh oh trouble now  haiku police will show how  writing should be wow 
jingle all the way   sequel was disappointing   no schwarzenegger 
rainy saturday  coffee break to ease the hurt  fragile solitude 
i have often thought  of friends who drifted away  now i fight the breeze 
we were always good  at discussing our feelings  but not talk of love 
i wish i had friends  then i would not write haikus  in my room alone 
she the huntress strikes   in a flash her prey is won   ninja in darkness 
how long shall i wait  as the time stands still for me  seasons come and go 
recently bought plants   green serenity at last   can't wait to kill you 
my eyelids a dam  ready to flood the cities  i cannot hold it 
moonrise claims the sky  a rebirth seizing the day  overflowing light 
the ground is thawing  i hear the birds singing songs  come alive it's time 
woof woof heard the man  had it not came from a babe  he may have heard wolf 
on cold nights like these  all i want is to warm up  by your hair of fire 
boring office day  but outside of the window  swallows are stunting 
the blades keep turning  staring up while the clock ticks  cage made of drywall 
so sure of yourself  if you act without hindsight  guilt will consume you 
hands grasping their neck  clutching until there's no air  i did this for you 
the morning sunshine  with you gently by my side  red streaks in the air 
whatchoo wanna do  make me wanna shoop baby  you make me wanna 
night in a city  illuminated darkness  stars covered by light 
tonight no tv  perhaps i'll be a poet  it could set me free 
the x marks the spot  no guide no topography  bad cartography 
divorce the big d  how did we lose each other  we really screwed up 
insipid scuttles  over floors of empty lots  these leaves are zombies 
attacks on freedom   the wealthy steal the country   cummings the lead rat 
the summertime breeze  resurfaces memories  that i never had 
after me made love  we laid together in bliss  under peaceful snow 
patience is the key  they say but god i'm waiting  been here for ages 
to you i now write  a letter with no reply  there is no more 
a calm mind shatters  a voice rumbles in my brain  mouths move in silence 
swing a sword or swing   pendulums hours we in sync   pandamonium 
i am full of fear  i start things i can give up  not things that matter 
pour in the city  the smell of heated asphalt  between the raindrops 
my anus quivers  faggoted virginity  taken by niggers 
the tides of time turn  our lives are eaten away like  rocks on the windy shores 
rightful and yet wrong  proud and yet miserable  it all goes away 
saffron rose petals  tumble on journal pages  blue ink afternoon 
these times feel alone  bottom of everyone's list  inner heart survives 
what are you hiding  what do you not want to say  what do you feel fear 
it's been a long time  since i posted a haiku  maybe tomorrow 
the archer takes aim  a blue eye through thin crosshairs  fruit succumbs to steel 
the damaged car and  attempts to resuscitate  both were towed for parts 
my favourite chore  during frosty weather is  feeding chickadees 
she saw my first breath  but now i have seen her last  i miss great grandma 
minds playing cursive  spiral down like a staircase  but to what extreme 
cardinal greeting  your eminence i said and  scattered stipend seeds 
hurdles before me  so many stop now never  grace is all i need 
who am i but one  unlovable soul stood still   just wishing for love 
adrift in wonders   as life passes before me   hath i enjoyed it 
come holy spirit  perfect for us is your grace  love never ending 
the blue ridge parkway  our personal get away  missing it today 
steamy dark liquid   lucidity in the fog   morning is for us 
impromptu poet  word hash unsalted verbage  flavorless haiku 
dusty afternoon  coffee rice and toasted bread  i miss you nana 
no color the same  but under the moon and stars  we all wear midnight 
let's go somewhere far  supported by the south wind  our endless journey 
united for life  one in love one in purpose  loving our journey 
do not stand or sit  the rope creeks as it tightens  slippers hit the floor 
drizzling winter day  no work nor tramping outside  ah second breakfast 
i want to go home  the only place i feel safe  the warmth of his arms 
nobuyuki plays  the gods stop to watch and cry  the blind pianist 
eat drink work play love  each one a drop of water  headed for the ground 
warmth and sunlight   dark clouds slowly encroaching   now i am ready 
if you want to speak  with special authority  show special talent 
goddam creaky doors  how many of you are there  in this effing house 
awake is the world  in bed we stay locked embrace   dreamers endlessly 
hands grasping young grace  venus's child last embrace  fresh grave stone flowers 
a loss of control  overwhelming sensation  nothing but regret 
twirling yellow leaves   the crisp air bellows through trees   orange mosaic 
the past is haunting  help release me from this curse  then love can blossom 
i imagine us  as sea otters holding hands  to not drift apart 
why did i sell out   giving my gifts to strangers   it should have been you 
love shared glorious  love bonds even in darkness  love is all we need 
cold anvil of grief   my aching arms carry you   while my love runs free 
surround they were  all my choices the exit  where can it be found 
i could nudge you now   but then you might awaken   keep snoring my love 
a kiss for your brow  my lips brush so close to yours  good morning my love 
a sweet salty treat  but man makes me so thirsty  no water so blood 
i like things meta   and i also like haikus   guess i'll merge the two 
you need to tell me  even though i know it all  and i know you do 
sitting by the phone  waiting for her to reply  but she never does 
time is like water  but so is everything else  could drown you some day 
holidays alone  if only i could be numb   i do not exist 
this day is unwell   terrifying sensation  the sweats and fever 
the sun shines above   my sons rolling in the grass   i seek the cool shade 
planning my escape  to where the grass is greener  one step at a time 
a catty remark  swiped across the heart leaving  a razor sharp sting 
children journeying  sharing joy sorrow hopes dreams  energized by truth 
a heart beats and weeps  not to live because its forced  no tearsonly the abyss 
legend of zelda   link's awakening is just   the absolute best 
he hid like she did  a mirror to her facade  it was unpleasant 
ashes to ashes  collecting fiery feathers  as we spiral down 
caught in a corner  the paper tablecloth whirls  practicing its dance 
seven deadly sins  could it really hurt that much  to commit just one 
fully elated  my heart never beat so quickly  i want this always 
if the sun should set  on all we have ever been  i had the best day  
a beautiful soul  comes from the most damaged heart  by newton's third law 
the ball is missing  the kids no longer will play  roofcomplains the dog 
monosyllabic  yes no cat dog bird tree house  one syllable words 
a ruby sunset  another day fades to dark  dawn will come in time 
all are resting now   retching cuts the night again   no sleep poor baby 
still island  lonely but lovely  lies in wait 
messages lightning  pails of tears spill eyes glisten  whispers fade arrows 
most beautiful rose  stem decorated in thorns  for you i'd strip bare 
overcast all day  finally july shower  doesn't cool things down 
everything here   is really all senryu   there is no haiku 
past me is a dick  he ruined my present life  man just screw that guy 
trees break for winter  tender heart aches for your love  old branches splinter 
dolchstoßlegende  cried the germans on their knees  you stab from the front 
i garuntee you  i can beat anyone here  in haiku battle 
she said i like you   but the answer was silence   big empty silence 
fingers flick and fly  others care but i do not  nothing matters bliss 
we've become distant  sharing something may fix this  perhaps morning would 
heater is on low   kept warm by my cats and dog   no need for blanket 
this girl is thirsty  and it is starting to show  it's not a good look 
pluto sitting in the dark  wanting back what was stolen  holding his heart tight 
your musky juices  running down my chin and then  dripping on my chest 
child we never met  for a time you were therejoy  now embraced by god 
i have a problem  i just want to write haikus   about the mothman 
howling north winds blow  those last obstinate oak leaves  nature's spring cleaning 
trees growing so tall  flowers beginning to bloom  green with spring anew 
update is ready  please restart now to install  your update has failed 
mailbox webbing had  spun federal law as it  advertised for bugs 
oh yes obama  you are the best president  obama sex yes 
the high is fading  prepare time for the come down  fuck that felt so good 
mighty little ant  please carry my rain buckets  i am very tired 
from the unformed void  yin and yang exfolidate  pulsing dance of life 
pain to start the day  lord i need strength and healing  let's start with a hug 
a star's light shines bright  in blinding intensity  truth is lost in dark 
with a tired sigh  burnt out by endlessnesses  i but toss and turn 
how sweet taste of spring  cold wind and snow returning  this day with you spring 
every post i see  is inferior to the  things that i think of 
quickly princess ants  enjoy your mating dance  the sparrows are massing 
i've messed things up  we couldn't have been lovers  i'm too far gone 
do not be surprised  when one acts in character  they have shown before 
silver and heart shaped  two faces behind clean glass  a locket of old 
sometimes i just need  a way to express my thoughts  without much effort 
many suppressed thoughts  no longer can they be shared  eternal regret 
it's true we all lie  when i'm honest with myself   i can never tell 
the morning rain  changing direction on  upside down canoes 
boring grey work life  some of the events are cool  same music each day 
played the lottery  didn't win here's more money  may i play again 
unworthy am i  how you love me perfectly  ever loving you 
sense of déjà vu  as if this happened before  and might yet again 
a love so intense  you said our bond is pious  tonight you're with him 
perception holds weight  perhaps a bit too heavy  internal turmoil 
i don't mind living  it's all gonna be fleeting  might as well dig in 
water breaks the shore  i stand in sand you at sea  current parts us more 
drinking black coffee  sweet bliss on my pinkish lips  ah the little things 
warm sunlight gazes  i throw a cold glare  onto your shoulders 
near the toppled chair  a basket of fresh cherries  never chew on pits 
smoking the best green   i have never been so high  relaxing on couch 
this rope will be nice  the refined dime winter ice  i hope i can die 
je suis taïwanaise  write that on my insta bio  to remind myself 
a patter of paws  eyes beam and tail wags with joy  familiar stench of death 
leaves are falling down  whispers of a frozen age  winter is coming 
mom leave me alone  the next morning  she really did 
freshly fallen snow  glistening like diamonds  my dog shits in it 
leaves thrashed by rainfall  although it only feigns fall  where wooden reigns fall 
return letter  unopened but know  what lies inside 
i bow to my heart  who waited so patiently  for me to arrive 
angler of my heart   i don't mind suffocating  hanging on your line 
her children indoors   spring the sullen beauty queen   grows irritable 
tears falling on stone  a widow weeps bitterly  love lost forever 
the day spent dreaming  my progress remains stagnant  get to work dumbass 
creating deceit   these people thrive in the dark   with flying monkeys 
command me my queen  body you simple vessel  waiting yours to fill 
when will you learn when  will you learn that your actions  have consequences 
i watch my child grow  there beyond the years of time  he watches his own 
the nightmarish dreams  that terrorized my childhood  have returned to hurt me 
a brew   a view   and a haiku subscribe it's free 
the word of silence   unspoken yet bellowing   whispers quell its voice 
with closed eyes inhale  young again in nighttime air  yet exhale we must 
echoes of the past   i will not pull this trigger   time to be silent 
stiff autumn breeze blows  through the trees knocking off leaves  for me to play in 
beware mastery  nothing known is ever known  truth's a visitor 
you have been the strength  sit with me and rest a while  you are protected 
crickets in the dark  sing among themselves all night  a sweet harmony 
as the clock ticks down  and our bones begin to creak  regret starts to seep 
medium of thoughts  language bridges mine to yours  articulation 
raised with good manners  folding the linen cloth but  left the stone open 
in a cold dark mist  heavy breath and fogged windows  continue our tryst 
first sweet fruit of spring   sweet red berries seeds outside   taste nothing like straw 
i see you often  there with me there when i sleep  it was just a dream 
a genuine question  for the moderation team  why no politics 
slouching willow tree  rigid against the strong gusts  an umbrella falls 
herds of the undead  dragging their gray decayed flesh  wanting my fresh brain 
soda pop for one   drown your thoughts with my wisdom   air bubbles top sides 
your will be done lord  faith hope placed only in you  i choose you always 
a little spider  moves back and forth on its web  playing with the light 
you keep so hidden  though your beauty does not compare  purple petals please 
you should have some fries  i like to consume with dips  normally ketchup 
i held leaves and grass  soft humid and freshly cut  does it feel like life 
imagination  conceptualisation  creativity 
sitting in the rain  drying off with the lightning  at one with nature 
sweet birdsong sunshine   steam rises from cup of tea   here i sit at peace 
droplets of water   do not know the sea exist   ignorance is bliss 
the passionate one   sweet innocent cheerleader   chameleon effect 
to you you roamer  be happier there instead  live in that sweet bliss 
drunk we embraced death  summer nights chasing light speed  our souls crashed for us 
dust on the old road  the scent of fallen apples  autumn leaves me too 
verbal knife cuts deep  words bleeding forth my life force  antidote to pain 
a tree's shade  cool summer breeze  warm sunlight 
lakes evaporate  remember rain houses shrink  where do the fish go 
an observation  the things i try to avoid  they are the real tests 
sleeping gossamer  corner of my eye it haunts  you're gone but still here 
sleep or not to sleep  romeo just had to ask  sleep is for the weak 
more than flesh and bone  an entity of passion  yet all too human 
an unused blade rusts  persistent practice passion  retains its sharpness 
the bow cuts through froth  an angry blade breaking waves  a humpback follows 
in summer rain  a cup emptied out  will soon be filled 
my shadow urges   me softly to get vengeance   for those trodden on 
camping for the night  a sleeping bag leaf with a  spider sewn inside 
things i need to do  guitar relieves all my stress  okurimono 
sitting on a bench  i share my heart with the ducks  quack quack quack thanks ducks 
dark thunderheads march  we hide safe locked and shuttered  smothered in our beds 
hope for president  but instead we keep the queen  such dark time ahead 
the teenager says   you do not understand me   they are ridiculed 
happy little girl   why is it so heartbreaking   to watch you grow 
he pulls at my strings  this shadowy puppeteer  forever pulling 
warm body cold mind  that travels through space and time  vehicle driver 
heed this prophecy  we're all destined for greatness  learn to know thyself 
'a pig or a dog'  my thought on first seeing you  now your snores mean home 
it strikes me as odd  knowing i'm part of nature  watching the leaves change 
i wait in the cold  for several long minutes  scanning hopefully 
love in your eyes friend  there we touched embraced and loved  closed nowremembrance 
old souls remain while  their embers restfully burn  down into friendship 
bossy barrels and  supervising signals are  managing the drive 
i know you're wicked  but each drag's a sweet reprieve  i'll quit tomorrow 
a fat man pounds corn  alone in the freezing cold  squirrels screech on the roof 
a haiku writer  grad student who runs for fun  loves to read good books 
breathe in   breathe out  what next 
sonshine filled my day  your joy love and gifts for me  all i ever need 
a short summer's storm  wintry rain falls on my face  i do not feel it 
humans in a room  a tired mind a tired body  joyous existence 
take my ship tonight  heart on an expedition  battered on the rocks 
no waluigi  we wanted waluigi  damn it nintendo 
birds chirping shrilly  spring is in the air  empty nests waiting 
simmering sunset   slowly seasons salty seas   sandy shores sing songs 
ragged eyes looked back  to a magical moment  devoid of regrets 
biggest ball of fur  energy like no other  gimme a hug mate 
your sorrow and grief  has overtaken your heart  but i'll stand with you 
seeds need help to grow  feer can be driven away  all it takes is time 
we are one family  knight errants of the divine  forever ever more 
stop falling in love  it is not good for the soul  loneliness is god 
everyone is wrong  i am the only sane man  which means i am not 
be kind to my heart  it's been wounded in battle  far too many times 
i am better now  still have lots of big problems  i'm bigger than them 
spilling words from murk  reveals your self expression  misuse of language 
there is nothing worse  including hitler stalin marx  it's a prius driver 
wanna start a fight  tell em that sauce isn't right  barbecue sauce wars 
twelve o'six am  words scatter and escape me  fugitive letters 
beat your worn war drum   summon up the courage to   continue ahead 
constant sand falling  leisurely burying me  can't seem to climb out 
i am behind you  everything you pursue  i got your back bro 
lost in the forest  in the shadows and silence  we find our true self 
no funeral please  pretend like i was never  even here at all 
how painful it is   to have loved and to not have   lost it all just some 
confused idée fixe   riddled with anxiety   endless tortured thoughts 
life is meaningless  but so is the rest i guess  we might as well live 
knowledge in paper   forests disappear fast   trees now in the past 
i'll take any love  the couch you lay on at night  wanted but just used 
an old woman sings  a lullaby in the spring  alas thunder growls 
in the hospital   i wish you knew who i am  i love you mommy 
wreckage in the rearview  focus turns to the windshield  be curious 
bought my prescriptions  went back the following day  receipt still printing 
they say love yourself  you deserve a love that heals   self love is hard work 
autumn leaves falling  walk and hear the crackling  winter is coming 
those empty spaces  by your absence long ago  were filled life goes on 
melancholia  restless agony plagues me  comfort eludes me 
don't be too afraid  to speak with superiors  don't give them power 
the equation changed  added subtracted and split  interesting times 
the shuttling flakes are  looming winter blankets for  a seamless snowfall 
at the rider's roost  where connie cannot be found  fancy sheds for sleep 
deep in the attic  baby dolls go there to die  whispering mama 
the heart of the home  contemplating flat screens with  a mantle remote 
we laugh holding hands  as the ocean runs away  on the train ride home 
shiny frozen lake  life suspended under ice  will return in spring 
a foreign invader  freezes bodies while in motion  our collective fortune 
slow dancing shadows   whispering in the moonlight   serenity's veil 
the new flowers bud  spring smiles fondly on new growth  summer days nearby 
she started a fire   in his forest of ashes   and watched it burn down 
every successful  marriage ends with watching   as the other dies 
should the fire raze us   our spirits will burn brightly   than napalm showers 
days we danced and laughed  moments stamped upon my soul  now fueling hope 
shakespeare has no words  for our affection bloomed  through cold winter days 
here i am screaming  the forest quivers and wakes  downed the birds fly by 
rain clouds but no rain  promises of affection  dry grass underfoot 
paper pen and hand  come together to save me  this my religion 
stupid tumblr girl   i like your septum piercing   and your lack of thoughts 
try meditation  maybe some vitamin d  add to cart buy now 
empty litter box  mocks my waiting open heart   need some cat poop now 
asphyxiation  you think it's air your breathing  fires filling lungs 
your giftamazing  joy fills warms heart and soul  how awesome lord 
i just write haikus  as i lack the energy  for anything else 
your face in a crowd  a milieu of voices hum  our eyes lock briefly 
alone i sit here   just twiddling aimlessly  with no end in sight 
all is imperfect   even the light breaks through prisms   expect some losses 
cherry tomatoes   blue eyed stare wandering off   finger snug in hand 
if you see something  that doesn't look right speak to  a member of staff 
nowam i ready  nowmore remains to be done  nowyour will be done 
struggle to maintain   adversity begets strength   threshold exceeded 
a dank earthen breeze  speaks of buried rusted rot  long since forgotten 
turn back says the world  love yourself is the message  i choose to love you 
past thoughts and musings  now overcome by events  erased forever 
nowadays we're dams   we're all gonna burst at once   try turn on a tap 
sideways snowing bent  carrot noses out of joint  stiffening their scarves 
the oak leaves i haunt   listen to me whispering  a long gone dead chant 
barriers to climb  i will not be discouraged  every day a step 
hungry booklover  feasting on literature  eyes devouring words 
a violin sound   a white blanket of snow falls   a worm cozy shed 
little droplets fell  wiped away by the next drop  all impermanent 
stone of red jasper  gifted by a late mentor  meaning gleaned too late 
all she cares about  is sex and pretty colors  and anyone but me 
beautiful creature  quietly stands in the dark  waiting for its prey 
i suck at haikus  do you have any advice  thank you in advance 
her prerogative  changed a lacey dress into  pinging beads of ice 
lincoln got shot dead  old washington never lied  who were the others 
i did fall in love  expecting her to catch me  but i hit the ground 
be humble in life  look up to the sky and see  see how small you are 
a bend in the road  the tombstones of lumbered trees  litter the hillside 
jacarandas bloom  can you see from your window  itchy ears miss you 
lambs watch in silence  the dead cannot scream for us  india's burning 
life is a journey  through the wilderness to get  to the other side 
poetry is what  if the word order matters  forget about it 
sometimes stomach cramps  mean only one thing to me  diarrhea pain 
like a waterfall  causing infinite ripples  and rainbow colors 
came into this world  out of mother's vagina  and never looked back 
cowboy falls in love  she destroys his life  in the end saves both 
my heart seeks you   a ring buried in the dirt   yet my soul moves on 
icy spring wind gusts  mirrors emptiness inside  trunks and limbs shiver 
like cancer's beckon  foulest beast a twisted thing  that sweet cold release 
an ode to the spleen  dutifully filtering  lymphocytes are made 
it's an art that portrays  optional norms  no limits in expression 
she sat and cried  on a quiet tram or in her bed  a broken branch 
it's scary in here  i don't like any of this  what are these monsters 
your life and mine are entwined  together we will accomplish all  everything that we set our minds too 
embrace all buddhas  reject the artificial  dissolve your ego 
every doggone day  why can't i end them in peace  hush little baby 
woooomf car door closes  sealed in this can of silence  parking lot at work 
ablaze like the sun  hidden by the shadow moon  raidiant but dark 
a dream about you  flashing by like lightening  leaves me emptier 
what i failed to do  haunts me drags me downdarkness  love brightens my day 
now that my minds blank  probably the perfect time  for this old bullshit 
fingers run through hair  she enjoys when i do that  go deeper baby 
on the highest branch  a squirrel plucks and cracks pecans  the shells land at my feet 
under the moon i  wander into the night i'm  illuminated 
stumbling through life lost  faceless in the crowds of men  i crave to be seen 
fall days warmth recedes  your presence warms my soul lord  you knock enter please 
his body withstood  dropping degrees while smiling  with his charcoal teeth 
black blue red yellow  with changes and mixtures  forever flows true 
bag of happiness  sunshine on a cloudy day  temporarily 
every shark has tears  rolling down that are not seen  all for salting seas 
conversationlove  hearts and minds connectedjoy  a taste of heaven 
a boy and balloon  rolling happily when they're  both tied to a chair 
election looming  accidental president  vote for covfefe 
houses in a row   wind chimes singing out of tune   quiet little street 
drops held by a branch  they cling but fall on my head  the trees are crying 
soliciting bugs  blinking their neon light for  an evening mate 
she smiled to me  undeniable kindness   eternally mine 
thoughts do remain   in mind i try to refrain  hearts home forbidden 
if i ever smile  it mixed with the raindrops  unwashable stain 
first ripe fruit of spring   sweet red berries seeds outside   taste nothing like straw 
beyond antares  the skies are green and glowing  my heart is waiting 
a bronze pieta  held a pool of water in  his passion for birds 
the morning rain  changing direction on  upside down canoe

distance our context  from shadows we silhouette  appear then sunset 
eternal music  blowing through the dark forest  never to be heard 
broke and on your own  laundry on saturday night  life as a student 
stormy's tantrum is  tottering trees and flinging  rain from the branches 
the room is all black  insomnia crashes in  the loudest darkness 
i was the asshole  who told you what i wanted  but we both don't know 
the person park for  unharnessing humans while  dogs yap out their day 
ever nomadic  bonds made and broken often  i begin again

a bright new day dawns  the coasts of japan sparkle  she makes her own path 
garments fly like a  scattering flock of birds  need to feel you now 
fear of rejection  relief in your acceptance  my secret is told 
overhead banging  headboards joyfully mocking  my loud loneliness

just a single day  us president haiku  then back to normal 
create new freedoms  only in america  targets of new law 
little monsters come  mounds of candy piling high  laughter in the night 
amalgamation  a mix of man and metal  move mound and mountain 
today you told me  that you and i are the same  we share the same soul 
the wind and the rain  grey clouds that slowly pass by  enjoying some tea 
dissapate with me  ready set let go of what's here  love gone forever 
beginner white belt   the path is never ending   beginner black belt 
thoughts you send to god  have never left your ape skull  it's time to grow up

my toes and fingers  cold as midnight betrayal  unfurl in summer 
when i smell compost  or fresh cut pine i smile  and think of opa 
courageous squirrel  crosses dog infested yards  on a black tightrope 
stepped on a golf ball  just now fuck me jesus christ  thank god i don't bowl 
what shall this child be  once was asked of you and me  love is the answer 
the most silent nights   adrift and frozen in sleep   slumbering beauty 
skin so tan and taught   bang you till the break of dawn   love with every beat 
morning rays warm skin  i am the golden sunlight  but also the blue 
marbled clouds above  frosty earth and fresh cool air  breathing in and out 
dew on gossamer  silver in the moonlit night  waiting silent still 
neither said a word   sat picking morning glories   down by the courthouse 
roots that spine the curb   sidewalks turn back to nature   dehumanizing 
i am black and blue   from all the 'pinch me' moments  i have had with you 
hot steam fogs the glass  dancing leaves move up and down  clear water now dark 
our minds obsolete  we all try to understand  through lifes complexion 
how beautiful are  these divers atoms gathered  born unto a soul 
berries and nuts  hang from december branches  set by squirrels 
woven masterpiece  but humanity also  entwined our garbage 
transfer of matter  something dies as we grow old  replaced by something 
afterlife makes death   feel deathless and misguided   especially life 
coffee in system  dreams ready to soar up high   sleep a distant friend 
rubbish politics  just delete and make it clean  my haiku pristine 
a personal goal   do no harm but take no shit  and this is the way 
take the cherokee  sell their life to bourgeoise  made now japaney 
with sharp glinting eyes  a tanuki creeps quiet  all the sake's gone 
long the preparation  short swift the final days  proceed with trust 
what seems is not truth  i know with reality  silent where truth lies 
hung by unseen hands  milky pearl omnipresent  atop a still lake 
an identity  built solely to conceal faults   aren't you tired 
i hit rock bottom  wind whispers through the river  your kayaking sucks 
speaking quietly  sometimes wiping away tears  old men talk of war 
before the warm red coat  golden feathers adorned  my chicken dinner 
stuck under my thoughts   i'm buried with my lost words   forgotten still felt 
soft powdery snow  plastic shovel loudly scrapes  empty stomach churns 
a good night of sleep  will heal many of my wounds  the gift of shut eye 
snow the mountain's crown  cloak of dusk about her feet  incensed with wood smoke 
the house of horrors  where a deathly demon dwells  born without her horns 
gnats in my kitchen   flying every where they can   are they even friends 
absorbed by the flower  i hadn't even noticed  the falling rain 
a cold wind this day  breath of god warmed body soul  life is worth living 
haiku to show you  the most relevant lines first  we have sorted this 
glistening starlight  in a field alone with you  you fill it with love 
if there is only  one love lost among billions  then we are all doomed 
deft mottled finch   digs rail tracks for crumbs  no luck this time 
floating in the air  in the spring skies to be seen  petals of white and pink 
approach a brick wall   confident you can scale it   what if you cannot 
i mourn the day i  almost freed myself from your  damaging clutches 
time passed is life spent  the present holds completely  all that can exist 
desert arose   illusions darkened stars   shimmering mist 
through the spilled ink and  overused words i try to  make sense of my thoughts 
contemplate living  search within the mind  desire to be 
what is a haiku  a smile for me one for you  it is happiness 
the black dog never   leaves allows peace calm or truth   the black dog always 
a wet runway ride  slick rubber tires slide slide slide  metal and rubber 
bang muzzle flashes  an accidental discharge  tale of conception 
know who rules the world  probably not who you think  illuminati 
this is not a poem   this is not a piece of art   i am all alone 
dear little flower  lift your head now open up  it's time to blossom 
what if i was done  with lists rides graces and meals  and it disappeared 
lying awake to prisoners cries  while the outcasts are bringers of justice  i long for the day 
out of the blue you  got in touch to say hello  but left soon after 
dripping endlessly   i count each drop ignoring   the pool beneath me 
the taxi hours  slow going christmas blue through  the fatigued city 
tests of faith appear  and decisions must be made  our worlds are at war 
the last airbender   thanks for this blessing netflix   helps out quarantine 
i lay on my bed  hoping to dream peacefully   but i'm so awake 
sweet sounds of death  they are filling up my mind  i'm not a monster 
earlier sunsets  summer draws out it's last breath  autumn's scowl daunts me 
just had some starbucks  imminent diarrhea  god what have i done 
our thoughts are just notes   through words we share melodies   so please fill the score 
one nestling skipping  predator jaw leaps forward  child me's memory 
autumn standard time  gives me momentary blues  dark sky comes too fast 
neptune blue as an ocean  last among his brethren  guarding the outside 
black tiger mocha  extra chocolate half caf  whipped cream but no bean 
it is only you  you are my toy delighted  i am not disadvantaged 
i deleted my  pst file and now my  outlook doesn't start 
my only desire  remove harm and suffering  selfless compassion 
mind clouded by thoughts   to be stressed and strained by time  lo does it beckon 
butterflies since when  i first saw you and they flew  to where i wanted 
on a day like this  lost you in a deep abyss  fuck days like today 
listen to me please  and when you are done talking  hear me then again 
trees freezing lose leaves  but in springtime they renew  maybe i can too 
morning birds chirping  i sit in my gilded cage  a pandemic life 
plaids unravelous  paisleys land in leafy piles  polka dots repine 
sometimes when you lose  everything you come to gain  more than what you had 
the edge of the wedge  the gilt upon what we've built  how sound is the ground 
your mom is from niger  and she is a great nagger  who nags me my nigga 
how am i today   sunny day with my raincoat   ya know just in case 
now that we've had sex  and you are softly snoring  i can browse reddit 
i hope people care  but the feel they feel no sympathy  nor is it deserved 
sentiments and truth  speak only if they listen  you are worth yourself 
he didn't look back  she waited for a response  but he walked away 
i need some insight  inspiration for my work  send suggestions please 
evening lights shine  brightening the way like stars  guiding emptiness 
worshiping false gods  dangerous idolatry  be very careful 
sitting in the rain  she never felt so alone  watching him drive off 
next sunday in most  us states and canada  we must change our clocks 
it's raining outside  i check the weather on my  iphone x smartphone 
all are shades of grey  the sun chooses not to shine  we cast no shadows 
anticipation  equalization  unification 
a blue jay band  dancing between naked trees  grey winter light 
stop buying tp  you do not need what you bought  i work at publix 
tonight i will write   a haiku for you my love   stars shine for us all 
advice for those in   a difficult position   first be flexible 
cozy with grampa  but can't turn the page for him  on a kindle book 
lurking in the dark   deadpool says something snarky   then he opens fire 
sunshine through windows  lovers radiate on screens  brisk separation 
blast paranoia  particles stop fellowship  death puppets weak steps 
you're caught up in love  appreciate the moment  however fleeting 
the thrills we shared   in the long dusks of summer   fade into memory 
what is a shower  a hot chemical cocktail  for you to get clean 
the gamer ponders  is it summer already  onwards to his fall 
steering past the signs  blurred lines and blind spots can wait  time split like lightning 
not much better than  pussy freely given and  the worst is taken 
hot gust envelops  dry leaves natural tinder  billows of smoke rise 
does an ant get tired  would it matter if it did  it can never stop 
hometown funeral  driving home a railroad wreck  something in common 
boredom strikes time lost  freedom comes with love service  hope and joy with you 
this and that surround  naming is the origin  of all delusion 
side by sidehow sweet  love shared is love remembered  celebrating us 
beat it just beat it  red leather zipper jacket   what was with the glove 
the sun glows brightly  filling vacant space between  winter's dead branches 
i am a robot  a soulless automaton  forever alone 
a secret garden  wind whispers serenity  my soul is peaceful 
unquestionably  never doubt my heart on this  yes black lives matter 
when you hug someone  and they hold a bit longer   a split second bliss a split second bliss 
first melt the sugar  then add the butter and cream  oh sweet caramel 
idling sloth joy smirk  furiously steady work  proven respect twerk 
thick layers thin lines  human and tree spirit maps  death reveals the past 
heart felt truth from you  misguided lies told to me  feels misunderstood 
the people you hate  are the enemies of those  who taught you to hate 
rain was coming down  happiness and joy no more  then you come along 
a spider runs by  another innocent soul  my foot comes down hard 
watch the world away  faces people in a crowd  empty crowded space 
a rising tide swells  a wave that sweeps all under  the perfect punchline 
the snow fills the gap   between pines and the warm sun   you are the cold snow 
the night's upon us  but while you sleep i must work  alone with my thoughts 
he wanted my type  but was annoying so i  smacked him on my arm 
familiar warm waves   when you are near i can't speak  will you hurt me too 
swimming in a small lake  tomatoes falling into arms  enriching spirit 
abandoned all hope  life seems like a blur right now  might be from the tears 
a whispering wind  sheltered from the savage storm  my heart stays with you 
cat is sick again  what fresh new disease awaits  he is immortal 
unforgiving streets  precede your gentle embrace  a break in the clouds 
a spark on snapchat  will it exist in person  i hope we find out 
i write them all here  because i lack the courage  in that other life 
silence in stillness  exposes my mind's secrets  buried deep by noise 
morning garden path  snail makes glistening tracks  crunch now i will too 
cinco de mayo  my brain explodes in my head  why did i drink that 
little frog in grass  i hide too from taxes but  the mower still comes 
gentle rain falling  upon my protective roof  sleep comes easily 
spindles embracing  tangled mort fluid exchange  vaccum out the goop 
she held my face and  she sang the part of the song   that explained her heart 
your heart i reach for  only you can let me in  please let down your walls 
soft round motherly   intuitive healer moon  don't hide behind the clouds 
math homework now gone   consuming my time   this'll be worth it 
in the looking glass  seasons appear as one form  none are as they seem 
eyes and sleep fighting  like yoshitsune and benkei  on the gojo bridge 
may drinking and smoke  bury my heart six feet deep  let time fill the hole 
the brave little frog  jumped quickly across the road  hop hop hop hop squish 
blue mottled with black  thick clouds clot above concrete  right eye swollen shut 
furry squirrel runs   rushing to hide his nuts   winter is coming 
all aboard the train  a message from the driver  my life is off track 
your kids are at risk  trust fund baby donald trump  liar coward prick 
i would die for you  and the beautiful thing is  you would never ask 
my cake day just passed  i hated every minute  four years yesterday 
beaming he looks on  having walked her down the aisle  father of the bride 
winds of the past haunt  now the sea is calmer  future unwritten 
i am alive as  a miracle of nature  as is everything 
it took a while  for her to bring down her walls  i was right behind 
broken umbrella  sprouts from a metal trash bin  drowning azaleas 
hallucinogens  sexual accessories  saturday night love 
mouths open to speak  and ears ready to listen  the school year begins 
a whisper of me  my shadow forever gone  memories all fade 
your reality  the moment your eyes opened  is the universe 
beneath sky wanders  rusted leaves fall luminous  on stained sheets untold 
something very deep  this haiku is meaningless  stop being edgy 
ain't got nuthin fresh  i rely on fart jokes now  the duck ran that way 
it is so empty  the sky has nothing special  yet so beautiful 
are you exhausted  no everything is alright  he was not alright 
monotony blends  days like seconds slip away  never slowing down 
stardust for breakfast  juicy galaxies at night  dancing in the light 
this world is just noise  life has become alien  love is all that is clear 
to know tragedy  and the strongest joy is to  obsess over love 
i loved you in the  old world and i will love you  in the new world blink 
i tried on my mask  my mom made it by herself  once curtain fabric 
albums of old love  pictures of babies and trips  where is my scrapbook 
like moth to a flame   the invisible sickness  slowly engulfs her 
barren blue skies woe   what's it like to be alive   the shy dim stars woe 
cracked road follows thought  small boy pedals off of mark  tears fall from aged eye 
the hamper is full  laundry from dryer is warm  are these all my socks 
the harvest moon shines  let's go plant some tomatoes  and find me a wife 
i remember you  face widened by summer joy  something in my eye 
a silent dark night  dew drops rest on leaves waiting  for a trip to sky 
karma is a bitch  but only if i insist  on provoking her 
words cheap in value  deeds accomplishments treasured  do more than say more 
strange temperate winter  warms january jasmine  perfume in the mist 
the leaking tap fills  a droplet to let go of  another tear falls 
a fleeting sun lights  a fire across the sky  the world welcomes it 
you claim to love christ  but forgot to ask yourself  if he would approve 
headphones on my ears  to silence all the voices  thank god for music 
terrence oh terrence  you and catastrophism  could just be the key 
history may rhyme  some of the verses are known  only after death 
a supernova  brings the dark night sky to life  dead a thousand years 
desolate city  overgrown trees that waver  just an enigma 
brief meditation  deep breaths and judgeless thoughts flow  i am here and now 
a love so intense  you called our bond pious but  tonight you're with him 
forgive me my friend   i cannot help you today   i must help myself 
listen to the rain  hear the stories of the world  often left untold 
just simple darkness  water drips off my body  ignoring myself 
routine continues  weeks on and day after day  give me something new 
rain clouds and sunshine  arcs of colour through the sky  she's my pot of gold 
an alarm ringing  a child given an award  my dreams have been lost 
vultures so hungry   it is the circle of life   what makes your flesh great 
caught in the moment  pulled under by grief and loss  swift the river runs 
we are sojourners  spirit oppy curio  let us persevere 
again on this sub  dwelling on relationships  happier this time 
dirty pig in mud   happily alive and well   not on a clean plate 
crystals frost the air  a crescent moon casts shadows  icicles shimmer 
fuck this subreddit  the moderator can suck  a big juicy schlong 
this pulse between us  electric and alluring  we must never touch 
here to help you write  pm me your haiku please  i'll check it for free 
i wrote a sentence  split with two forward slashes  and called it haiku 
i have a twitter  dedicated to haiku  i hope you read it 
leaves on a maple  burst red with the shorter days  falling to the ground 
oh my you and i  before now tomorrowlove  never will we end 
meaningless haiku  layered sparsely with meaning  means nothing at all 
my dog licks my arm  during tonight's thunderstorm  with her eyes closed shut 
the flavor of dogs  mingling with the boardwalk and  relished on a bun 
stand up for yourself  you're your greatest advocate  fighting warrior 
attention drifting  i tell myself to focus  don't like statistics 
the iron cannon  loaded in peacetime with the  birds packing a truce 
before the white death  a ghost in the trenches lay  a spirit of the wind 
two flags one nation   what an abomination  need a salvation 
in the shadows dark  the joker is listening  take care how you speak 
yo no entiendo  learnt that for my cuban trip  then got overcharged 
you only can only read   all haikus this easily  thanks to jacksfilm's song 
imagine my shock  the blood all left my body  where could it have gone 
a torrent of thought  spills the banks of consciousness  washing life away 
husband is away  blinds down door locked phone off hook  a secret affair 
your mouth shook gaining  the character of a book  carried through danger 
all those moments lost  like tears in summer showers  washed away by time 
why is no one here  in a room full of people   someone listen up 
losing her edge while  strutting with the collie and  elimination 
restless eyes open  dark light fills the void with ease  dreams are not promised 
blinding white moonlight  the red figure stands proudly  while the eyes still gaze 
now i will be blunt  optimism's struggle cold  all of it pointless 
your words for me read  absent are your emotions  dreaming of presence 
i changed my core  to fit around you the best  i could and it failed 
craving games outside  conversations over drinks  summer fun again 
cool breeze in the night  whispers drown out the ringing  restless without them 
shadows hazards diversions  straight path crooked walk forward  goal in focus 
how interesting  one song can still stall my heart  duet turned solo 
waves against the beach  infinite force of nature  violent yet at peace 
you were invited  why did you leave so quickly  loving you always 
wet leaves   steam from the tea   warmth of your skin 
pink clouds on blue sky  reflecting the moon's daylight  night round the corner 
you were nice to me  when i had no faith in me  i want to say thanks 
autumn convinces  the trees to part from their leaves  and let them fall free 
music and daydreams  so profound i drown they end  i am here again 
tragedy heartbreak  something we all encounter   you will push through this 
haikus in this sub  are a fun way to help me  forget about you 
place here nature words  now for some descriptive words  i wrote a haiku 
dry rocks and boulders  bake under pitiless sun  where is the river 
what does it mean when  i want nobody else but  it hurts to be here 
yesterday's haiku  means nothing whatsoever  no bridge no water 
atmospheric room  talks fueled by curious minds  strangers turn to friends 
whichever i pick  indica or sativa  which star to shoot for 
remember when we  took a bath while the world was  burning around us 
darkened afternoon  warmer days a memory  snow fluttering by 
perennial stream  swift in heart flow my mind  looming consequence 
vegas chlorine pool  shines with the hot summer sun  playfully waves on 
to see it again   makes me warm happy inside   that sweet smile of yours 
youtube video  glasses with his violin  will you love me too 
this drunken evening  i used you as a toilet  just a little joke 
beauty in struggle  the emotions of my past  listen to music 
i died in my sleep  somebody needs to tell me  how i wake back up 
gang mentalities  explain their brutality  'to serve and protect' 
the virus rages  a month later and i still  cannot catch my breath 
a cold winters night  drifts by in the inky swirl  there shines 'silver pearl' 
the united states  land of depressed broken scared   after all its home 
someone once told me  become the rose that grows in  between the concrete 
wine tastes different   if you take a sip alone   or among good friends 
my dreams are full now  your color your temperature  pressed behind my eyes 
each dandelion  we made wishes together  i wished yours came true 
dreams can flee  through the bushes and out of sight  hunt them 
we are like microbes  zits and blackheads and pock marks  on earths graceful skin 
i want to die now  put a bullet in my skull  will i regret this 
link by link by link  the internet grows bigger  now it spans the globe 
this syllable count   if we could all just have one more   i would be most hap 
miles separate us  yet we're inseparable  i know it will last 
confession of love  when seen as motivation  becomes one of guilt 
cell phone poetry   rhythms hiding in plain sight   time to call my mom 
the heat of the scotch  kindles a warm memory  to happier times 
in dark moon shadows   my blade reflects around   a petal is cut 
you look different now  the same love a different feel  sorry i'm not sure 
ah the rain returns  beautiful morning to sleep  but there are babies 
found an open book  rosetta stone unwritten  read between the lines 
sleepless solitude  sleeping next to wrong person  both are lonely nights 
soy marihuano  las nubes en mi cuarto  ojos estrellados 
how do you expect  to find love in this time of  social distancing 
oh zero zero  how negative whoa is me  pee stain on my jeans 
refrigerator  homosexuality  all the gays are cool 
i love who you are   to me a light in darkness   a joy in my world 
my heart palpatates  all these people i don't know  watch me bare my soul 
as this year's roots spread  they will no doubt interact  with last year's corpses 
sunlight through the blinds  a lazy sunday with you  pizza for breakfast 
afraid to touch and  ignight the spark inside us  raging inferno 
her prerogative  was elaborate sequins  beading into ice 
watching the flames eat away  the logs in my fire  fascinating spectacle 
tears bond us  joy propels each step together  energized by love 
silly orange man  stuck in ways yet still unfazed  head buried in sand 
massive jaws stretched wide  gaping to consume the sun  screaming constantly 
sweet thoughts and kind words  now gone once taken for granted  lonely life burns out 
an old orange bantam  strutting proud with borrowed spurs  fails to see the fox 
the buzz wearing off  his doll deflating slowly  sir please it hisses 
luke skywalker dies  kylo ren kills master snoke  princess leia lives 
death is the end right  so why am i still awake  i feel everything 
tell me when and where  and for you i will be there  twenty minutes late 
the dry grass hums  ants are awakened  and go searching for dew 
the equaliser  the task at hand with eyes closed  cosmic impacts loom 
blindly i'm fumbling  hoping the lights turn on soon  wait where are my eyes 
who loves the spider  even worse than the mosqiutoes  no we hate them both 
i'm new to reddit  this sub has piqued my interest  it's pure poetry 
nectar to honey  but this bee need not flower  sweetness is in all 
the golden hew fades  violet extending forth  all encompassing 
from seed to the top  branches all under the sun   a pleasant shadow 
mocking bird wonder  tiny fractures on stained sheets  the bottle silent 
going back in time   when trojan was a present   not a virus 
your presence my joy  god's plan for you and ilove  so blessed are we all 
sitting here i be  writing this haiku for you  hoping to see green 
solitary thoughts   thinking of good times we had   face to the fall wind 
today i have learned  split sentences unwelcome  still learning mercy 
as the time ticks by  i mindlessly fill the void  but still wait for you 
afternoon drizzle  bird wings flapping in a puddle  its bath time 
like everything else  self awareness it turns out  always relative 
ātman and brahman  what boundary between them  all is anattā 
online piracy  not a crime without victims  hurting creators 
at the long table  when trying not to take sides  the world turns below 
time will bend for me  roaming in the twilight hour  i have been set free 
humans aren't we all  just pieces of the same leaf  leaves of the same tree 
cute critter crawler   consuming to cocooning   then boom butterfly 
many books to read  hidden behind these walls  knowledge gained today 
i stumble to sleep   on the soft stones of cartoons   and padded voices 
these cold winter nights  speaking in whispers they weep  turning the last page 
lonesome streetlight glow  families stir in their homes  america sleeps 
got all my stuff moved   carried boxes all day long   oh my achin' back 
hometown memories  never forget where you're from  nostalgia and more 
outside looking in  a spirit between two worlds  so close yet so far 
no one ever will  take haikus as serious as  real poetry 
the ice king cometh   dealing death where life once stood  our saviour jon snow 
this is the end part  here i'm adhered and not here  here we go again 
anxious gardeners  hurl debris into calm lakes  turbulent waters 
your fluids  my desire  one body for two 
should have known better  you said you wouldn't ghost me  now i'm stuck guessing 
middle or upper  can't tell by looking at them  they're the bourgeoisie 
the promise of flight   waiting in this concrete tomb   stuck at the airport 
your hidden struggles  how i pray in love for grace  please take my handwalk 
when life is clouded   when we forget who we were   how can we return 
the world is so cool  you can do a lot of things  yet somehow i don't 
one swipe to the right  a chat a coffee a walk  one kiss told me all 
a youthful car and  aging face with frazzled hair  rebelling the truth 
coronavirus  fever dry cough maybe death   grab all the bog roll 
bookends you and i  a story of love between  lord thank you so much 
stuck in this prison  shackled by complacency  bound by laziness 
sunshine kiss the moon   wind chymes rattle the window   eternally still 
should i be dragged down   if my ball and chain are so   so comfortable 
understand your pain   there is wisdom to be gained   in rumination 
faint rosey skyline  with just a clear red comet  of an aeroplane 
solitary tree   ornaments of pink petals   a black bird perches 
it's over she said  as we sat down for dinner  words cold as the food 
connected hearts minds  just a look is all it took  pilgrimswe journey 
before the virus  travel was an adventure  now it instills dread 
our whispering minds  make us our own enemies  to fight every day 
the bubbling molasses  of black worry's soup conceals  the dumpling of light 
leftovers of your  existence spread around the  apartment we shared 
man walks into bar  and says i'd like a haiku  the barman says sorry 
always wanting more  time to get up and get it  today is the day 
indecision  sweep it all under the rug   rat in a dead cage 
worldly joy tempts me  at what cost brief is the high  teach me lord this day 
my eyes are heavy  sleep calls but falls on deaf ears  i must finish this 
that music  all i have left  of a life gone 
illicit affair  lusting half a world away  longing to be near 
standing in my home  wire mask and a metal cage  steal blades cut the ice 
cocoon split apart  complete metamorphosis  butterfly takes flight 
a dark night closes  and as i open my eyes  bugs sing good morning 
i bare my sharp teeth  the laughter emits through them  the reason in front 
trick or treaters come   to a house without candy   i left my lights on 
a weed edible  it's not working i need more  i need ambulance 
spring caterpiller   my friend sitting on a leaf   soon you will have wings 
words held withinwhy  they are for you for us now  today let's converse 
too many nights lost  new season of life beckons  desire steers her mind 
i always crave hugs  they pull me in life's purpose  the tight warm embrace 
puddle in the woods  what an ugly sight in may  mosquitoes rejoice 
the mind is an ocean  on the surface waves are wild  below is stillness 
i dislike most things  however cloudy blue skies  gives my cold heart wings 
tick tick time flies by  many but never enough  grace is all i need 
thunder and lightning  a big boom a streak of light  a storm from within 
this void is lonely  it could use more spumoni  wouldn't that be nice 
unexpected rain  her smile was my umbrella  and then the sky cleared 
why should time be killed  when you have nothing to do  why not simply live 
your head and your hands  its the 'price of prescience'  my dear cicero 
lost in the snowstorm  i feel warmth emanating  a smoking chimney 
endless solitude  a smile as my pretty mask  hollow and empty 
mother and baby  peaceful in their slumbering  snuggled on the couch 
my mind is a prison  silent cries of solitude  someone set me free 
a hole in the ground  a box with old memories  a hole in the heart 
i'm alone again  it's just begun to get cold  the lake is frozen 
my mind is weary  i dreamt of dolphins last night  i was at last free 
no fear left inside  everyone wants to love you  free upon this wave 
get out already   you've been in there forever   the longest shower 
created to love  in every gift gracelove  me for you 
in a nicer world   there's no riddle take the grain   crossing the river 
old man fearing death  man in black taps his shoulder  not today my friend 
leaves falling floating   colours fading cold returns   winter is coming 
like scratching an itch  medicine to compulsion  joy to slavery 
unexpected door  a rotten rubber band snaps  his toenail unfolds 
true friends can act as  sturdy logs stoking your fire  for a few moments 
clocks no longer tick  time has no space when with you  universe free float 
beckoning blue pool  summer's master flatterer  reflects only sun 
did you find it yet   i checked everywhere there too   oh its in my bag 
i leaned into you  i thought you were solid ground  i am in pieces 
australia burns  and the glaciers keep melting  i can only watch 
i sleep in my bed  for a season dreamt with her  awoken by her 
the sun shines longer  crocuses push back the dirt  ospreys divebomb fish 
turds don't stand a chance  wipe it clean a fresh ass slate  but don't flushor else 
she has a berry   can be gulped down easily   monsters ate my wife 
neon lights flicker  car tyres hiss in the rain  a balcony view 
dandelion seeds  are strewing their candles from  her blustery wish 
a weathered headstone   here lies a polititian   their last honest words 
your stare penetrates  my heart my soul my very being  i will stay forever 
bloody throned rose  deadly beauty so pretty  wounds that cut deepest 
can't take it with you  golden coins fall through fingers  summer's wealth is spent 
we wait for summer  winter wears and wears us down  we settle for spring 
permanent the moon  even when you cannot see  it is always there 
when making friends with  buddhists don't get too attached  they certainly won't 
voluptuous lips  stained red by sweet strawberries  meet mine so softly 
if there is a god  she probably hates us for  calling her father 
fell in love again  she's at the chinese buffet  hope she likes her food 
empty coffee cup  the chattering noise  alone in the tabel 
slowly i'm used to  retelling our memories  with i and not we 
a bright sunny day  grateful for the warm weather  blue sky puffy clouds 
running in circles  chasing with no end in sight  the tail was my own 
their winter game of  i'm king of the mountain is  played in parking lots 
salted bone feathers  darting salmon now on bloom   rain buckets too soft 
she is a princess  so beautiful what a trip  she came from my dreams 
silent halls echo  cheers and whistles and clapping  the basketball drops 
this is my rifle  there are many like it but  this rifle is mine 
sometimes you can laugh  at slightly sinister things  even at your kids 
love was all you knew  tail wags never seemed to stop  a very good boy 
sitting in a bush  up down up down push push push  busted on her tush 
oh scooby dooby   where are you we have a job  i have scooby snacks 
seen through dusty blinds  one lark perched on a wet branch  morning light rising 
i bear a great weight  it is not anxiety  it is loneliness 
why do you do it  searching for the real you by  running all your life 
no color the same  yet under the moon and stars  we all wear midnight 
to find a purpose   is a thing one cannot do   the purpose finds you 
cut jalapeño  then i have to pee  someone kill me please 
secretly meeting  skirting the real purpose  what are we doing 
i woke up today   i looked over and saw you   i felt myself smile 
the silence is heard  irrevocably noticed  a screech owl breaks it 
i made a mistake  and you forgave me for it  let us celebrate 
i said i love you  she turned and smiled and died  the last i love you 
hoped you wanted me  but then i remembered that  you wanted him more 
he is a warm mass  with gentel snores that calm me  envelop me sleep 
singing songs gently  assuredly out of tune  words i never knew 
linux meet printer  no ppd downloaded  open terminal 
i got out of bed  small but monumental task  one day at a time 
softly fading flame  let me give you all my fuel  just to gaze at you 
fourth floor balcony  miniature men beneath  run pointless errands 
if only the sun would rest  if only the nights were long enough  if only i could stop time 
called in told a lie  can't get out of bed today  eight hours spent sleeping 
fingers swipe pixels  with heads bowed in piety  techno rosary 
play ball with the dog  don't take it back only throw  he won't come in now 
my brain hurts like hell   i should see a doctor now   oops it is too late 
perfect is your love  why don't i rejoice daily  i need a hug lord 
the great phil lynott  may your memory remain  within the black rose 
underneath your shirt  the skin of your back is cool  as we sneak a kiss 
the sea waves bursting   ebb a figure made of foam  is made of nothing 
texting along and  ignoring surroundings so  i picked up the ten 
i think not of joy  love circles like a vulture   pain has company 
oh i miss watching  your body glide through the world  a most perfect waltz 
jam my music high  loud enough to drown my thoughts   it's real mean in there 
thankful happyhearts  staying healthy together   vaccine day for us 
i found a body  eyes staring through the dumpster  her face is my own 
memory etched skin  angry ravines of self hate  those were sadder times 
naught but a sliver  the unspeakable anguish  the hidden splinter 
im covered in spikes  leave me alone dont touch me  just please go away 
are you gonna cry  are you gonna piss your pants  gonna shit and cum 
go to instagram  everyone cooler than me  i am a loser 
hey i get it now  he said too late for action  to an empty room 
the music maker  enamored by the dancer  two beats synchronized 
a dance of moonbeams  reflections of soulful depth  internal sparkle 
i might be racist  racist to the human race  you all fucking suck 
hearts are made of glass   i'm picking up the pieces   i bled out for you 
occasionally  i shed tears for the world's pain  otherwise i just stare 
sighmissing the mark  knowing and choosing wrongly  today a new start 
inner flames drive me  yet she took my breath away  what is even left 
fuck you you fucking   fuck i fucking fuck the fuck   out of your asshole 
heavy wet snow  a bough breaks  and scatters the birds 
this hand can't be mine  hurts when i write draw or dream  it's getting older 
out on the islands  is a cool old crib stone bridge  and lobster boats too 
visitor in the  night looking for a warm drink  so many stakes 
cool winter breeze out  floor is slippery hair wet  hot shower was nice 
laurel or yanny  polarised opinions  a blue and white dress 
walking past the park  green buds spring from naked trees  unbuttoned wool coats 
still water calm mind  mountains stand strong against waves  water finds a place 
i know you judged me   the moment that you met me   take another look 
dry patches of grass  wait patiently for the embrace  of cool summer rain 
a porcelain face  cupid's astral arrow strikes  and leaves me bleeding 
warming up by the fire  until my heart  unclenches 
starved without hunger  unmotivated i wept  completely inept 
warm hood to our backs  look up and grin fingers laced  our galaxy spins 
i worry too much  hope that doesn't bother you  it is how i am 
i should go outside  but i let the day slip by  thinking not doing 
blooming wildflowers  lay wasted by the cricket ball  summer has arrived 
unending boredom  searching for the answers in  my fridge and my phone 
love is a selfish   attempt to remain selfless   quite the conundrum 
in love i serve you  in love we seek together  in love we embrace 
the white morning moon  casts subtle springtime shadows  illumination 
seasonal sadness  unrequited love once more  can't shake the feelings 
i sometimes wonder  do trees feel your heart beating  touching their rough skin 
the stereos blare  wailing auditory waste  poison is toxic 
silence implies end  but leaves ambiguity  where a hope smoulders 
green grass colored yellow  sun waves heat with mellow coat  paint everything 
rising and falling  like empires and hopes through time  in out then again 
please be patient with me  i've got it all together  but you keep adding 
always had my back  even when i fucked up bad  love you mom and dad 
redesigned reddit  digg me baby one more time  redditors outraged 
winter woods in spring  radiant space hung in time  what will set it free 
living is calmness  energy a currency  i am fond of both 
your love gives me life  joy in serving you my friends  let us dance and sing 
egrets in my yard   the grass wiped from my burnt brow   falls in my iced tea 
unwanted advice  passes faster than raw eggs  in the dysentery 
you gave up on me   i loved you til the end  i only need me 
my mind in decline  fear strangles the life once lived  the end to opine 
looking for haiku  written by ikkyu please help  classical chinese 
brighter the starlight  darker deeper shadows cast  between them i stand 
playing in the mud  at a leaky faucet the  wasp is rolling pies 
monkeys sit with tea  enjoying every flake of snow  life is nice when warm 
turn on tune in drop  lsd with tim leary  mind expanded yes 
should my haiku rhyme  i learn new things all the time  but my rhyming sucks 
procrastination  keeping me under my sheets  a tranquil delay 
torn between the long  standing love for my wife and  my primal urges 
lying in her bed  i told her that i loved her  she smiles fear turns to relief 
everything changes  the first time you hold your child  ethereally 
cold winter mornings  swans napping on the river  make my feet feel cold 
all things fall apart  yet i continue to hope  i'm an idiot 
where speed is a pro  inertia is a con  on iced winter streets 
looking at my face  the crevices to show for  living sixty years 
staring at my phone  black screen mirrors my spirit  since you said goodbye 
first i beat my meat  then i yeet my skeet always  that is my motto 
jesusglorious  jesusforgiving my sins  jesuslead me lord 
the drum of his heart   beat through fists already she   picks out a coffin 
yes i ate the town  on the other hand i tithe  mint dill and cumin 
good thoughts then sad thoughts  every song reminds me ugh  how do i forget 
covid means caring  for others and yourself too  so wear a damn mask 
put the kettle on  life is short there's lots to do  better get to work 
flowers bob their heads  people hurry to shelter  birds flit in spring rain 
old school anime  cowboy bebop is good but  evangelion 
scissors should do it  do you think they're sharp enough  might just take a few 
a soft white feather  floating toward a hard ground  my hand captures it 
i'm bob seger's big  gest fan im bob seger's big  gest fan i'm bob seg 
with each new haiku  i find i am compelled to  count each syllable 
a vision long gone  is that what the future holds  a silly daydream 
beams of light strike down  the sky yells and cries enraged  my candle flickers 
the three little words  that changed my life forever  ride or die she said 
same old resting pond  soft breeze kissing the surface  goose bumps spreading out 
my roommate is black  im a really big brown boi  diversity is 
these words like riddles  filling your mind and the room  with silent questions 
the florida man  is making headlines again  what has he done now 
and the curtains close  on life death and the beyond  a wonderful show 
i heard something said  i then lost myself to it  i do forgive you 
so hot in berlin  that i have not realized  the first yellow leaves 
brought back from the brink  death is peaceful nothingness  i want to go back 
first its snow then green  violets and reds then gold  then brown then the snow 
nature gave a push  giving birth to october  in a cry of cold 
off rocks ricochet  sharp calls of the birds above  do they hear us too 
an ember ignites  that which they thought could not burn  my world turns crimson 
sit back and relax   then without warning a tug   a beautiful koi 
their screaming voices   echo down the corridors   silence them but how 
if only i could  unsee a film unhear a   song you'd be long gone 
the long summer sun  takes a break along my brow  in chapter sixteen 
christmas  family time  bring on the presents 
decide this day my friend  pray you will accept the call  turn and find your joy 
salt shooter then lime  see how many you can take  then puke your guts out 
a boy and a girl  holding hand in the night sky  eternal romance 
dimly lit carriage  through harvested autumn fields  hearts beat out of sync 
say your goodbyes now  background noise of the new day  will soon drown you out 
winds will come and go  sometimes bringing cloud or rain  change is natural 
don't limit your art  into a measured medium  find another one 
your joy touched my heart  fulfill their hopes and dreams lord  such is my prayer 
you fit into me  like a key fits in a lock  you open my heart 
serious oh no  i treat them like a bad joke  haikus are so neat 
a giant stone slab  the t'zolkin predicted change  they ran out of space 
october's last night  only the full moon  shows it's true face 
young girls in their teens  arguing with each other  over boy love books 
shoes tucked beneath our arms  we wade through warm water  and brush against tall grass 
firesky they say  in mythological tales  in reality 
accumulate wealth  think only of yourself since  greed's not good but god 
i threw a coin down  in a wishing well today  the coin sunk so low 
finding work to do   ungratifying again   tomorrow beckons 
time and time again  you lead me to joy and peace  i choose to follow 
in halcyon days  we used to run with the wolves  now we work for dogs 
sow fields from practice  hold prayers out to patience  be compelled and act 
sacrifice the young   so that they might understand   we went through the same 
choose to love no cost  persecution temptation  trust hope found in love 
an inner struggle  fighting many bouts with doubts  frequent opponent 
good morning sunshine  things are getting out of hand  breathe pull yourself up 
my cynicism  vs a tab of acid  with no survivors 
electricity  beefheart growls from pink deserts  miss zeta taketh 
from before my time  great music words that inspire  miss you tony sly 
friday again so  you know the drill drink until  unconscious and numb 
they told me be vague   dont stand out or speek my mind   keep it all inside 
the train goes forward   and i sit in silence all   the while looking back 
a country hook up  no map is reliable  i am surely lost 
beneath two bluejays  while digging in my garden  i found a haiku 
i sat beside you  sharing thoughts love exchanged joy  pilgrims hand in hand 
candle flame makes  flowerpots mysterious  stars twinkle above 
his brow glittered not  when earned sweat glitters golden  when filched it shines not 
raging waterfall  tumbles downwards angrily  roaring in my ears 
your struggles hidden  extending you patient love  your hand let us walk 
i live every day  but i will only die once  better make it count 
leave me misery   i let you into my heart   the pain lingers on 
my mind is a cage  with thoughts endlessly swirling  is there no escape 
burning elixir  drown me in the amber fire  cauterize my wounds 
the wind and the rain  stripping paint off toy soldiers  the sky shoots to kill 
is love anything    but basic reproduction    species continues 
distractions dart by   like a starved hound i pursue   as time escapes me 
hey we need to talk   are you breaking up with me   this is how it ends 
concealed by her shawl  but the zodiac tattoo  swam over the breach 
i know nice girl  and it was amazing first  but now it's tortune 
once upon a time  in a shoe she called her home  lived an old woman 
the speed of darkness  equal to the speed of light  one master one slave 
my balls are bulging  swollen up with sensual cum  size of a balloon 
we crossed paths today  mask and hat left me unsure  i hesitated 
her hair is graying   crows feet appear by her eyes   where has the time gone 
searching for presents   this side of christmas winter   i don't hate you yet 
a starch collar is  strangling the city in a  freezing winter fit 
brimming rays of sun   waiting to delve into the   corporeal soul 
will spring ever come  it is mid april right now  brr december temps 
i poop at work so  you can pay me to smell the  gasses from my ass 
when two strangers meet  a casual hello  the day shines brighter 
slicked back  my sons red hair  looks black 
soft rain on the wind  beautiful and meaningless  a sharp knife brings peace 
my book is published  on amazon now but my  marketing does suck 
windchimes are singing   witching hour is upon us   don't let them find you 
'he was a good man'   they all greeted me today   untrue i'm just dead 
swimming through darkness   searching for my one lost star   just out of my reach 
brittle gaze  through mesh of responsibilities  still can see humming bird jeweling salvia 
sunburnt to a crisp  the memories are baked in  our one perfect day 
a pool of blank ink  i want to dive into it  leaving lines behind 
burial ground comes alive   choirs of the dead   echo up well 
wild geese in flight  snow leopard is on the hunt  ice like shiny stars 
neglected trash bags  extends to every corner  of the neighborhood 
the cat is hungry  a predator stalking prey  the mouse becomes food 
little white wires  this ruffled patch of iron  stops my metal heart 
my daughter hates me   i brought her into this world   but i gave her up 
yin and yang exist  but not absolute values  not so black and white 
the early morning  perfect peace in the twilight  just tranquility 
wildfire smog rising  little frog crawling to hide  from the heat of sun 
as peaceful as snow  a quiet sense of true bliss   after we made love 
procrastination  you want to change that habbit  sooner or later 
single sunflower  searching the empty sky  there is no warmth 
standing in chaos  floors melting beneath my feet  hello delusions 
an outdoor market  juicy fruit fish meat and wine  the girl was stared at 
got a coke balloon  i just moved to a new house  lonley journey tho 
though this be madness  yet there is method in it  said polonius 
a newborn rain drop   breaking its tiny body   against the hard ground 
an epiphany   at just the perfect moment  will spark great ideas 
gnarled and bent old tree   rime and squall forge hallowed nooks   haven for new life 
every memory  happy or sad they all hurt  i miss you so much 
breaking point on verge  cracks showing pressure building  sooner than later 
they said i'd lose fear  after diving open sky  where planes and god play 
all about darkness reigns  only one light shines with truth  my eyes fixed on it 
sun set rose today  sand and glass away they pass  no sun rise today 
it's nice to find peace  inside from time to time in  the ever present 
math homework must do  anxiety crawling in  i might need some help 
when my assailant  took only one ten pound note  was that his conscience 
you did not forget  life lessons of love learned well  given to me thanks 
pretty little sheep  just wants to show off her dress  it looks nice on you 
quiet clouds migrate   the last sounds of nature sing   life yields fruit once more 
dry as desert winds  coarse as the salt from the sea  everything to me 
don't cry in your soup  report the post or modmail  hissy fits are bad 
baldness in mirror  a cascade of hairs fall down  at the barber's floor 
beads of bubbling red  leave streaks in the snow  this is a good death 
authoritarian  they do not understand why  life resists their boxes 
tupac spoke to me   i lie controversy sells   a clouded judgement 
words dance like ribbons  ephemeral candled ghosts  painted cavern walls 
if tragedy is  appealing then disaster  is an addiction 
this will be over  when i'm so spent i collapse  just drag me away 
now watching one piece  alabasta episodes  winding down the night 
even salted earth  dressed under blankets of snow  can be beautiful 
drip drip drip of rain  warm cozy fireplace cracking  turning pages chirr 
be like a big wave   says bruce lee in all his might   i am like a ripple 
i am doom i am   gloom the misfortune waiting  beyond your view 
dragged around by them  lied and made fun of i was  what a waste of time 
wild bird you teach me  to hold out my open hand  but not expect you 
clouds saluting me  as i fly away from home  with my onion wings 
grinding food like cud  grunting into the phone and  hogging public seats 
old trump can not read  his tiny hands too small  to hold any book 
the ocean collects  memories unforgotten  kept in her dark heart 
purity at its finest  storm song melody  one drop of rain in my bowl 
i fuck my teacher  the call it tutoring  gucci gang gucci gang 
my dad was a clown  i'm gonna be a clown too  it's big shoes to fill 
yo jack in the box   the spicy popcorn chicken   fuckin slaps so hard 
scenes once filled with life  now declining and fading  lord constant your light 
westward sun  nestled on rounded hills  stretching our shadows 
as birds fall silent  the east wind becomes stronger  words change to whispers 
a selfish depart  the grass is always greener  was this a mistake 
i return to you  the nose hair you plucked and flicked  you thought no one saw 
unstable strata  winds blast across the basin  tumbleweeds march on 
once again on app  to find one to sit on lap  sadly i look crap 
rotting in wisdom   housing forgotten answers   i am the old house 
calm waters calm mind  darkness fades in brilliant light  we rise together 
past the swaying oak   a traveling peony   guided by the stars 
with every upvote  we slowly improve reddit  upvote this haiku 
she's as sweet as a peach  but still i think of someone  that's sour as grapes 
after springtime rain  beautiful flowers sprout up  brilliantly blooming 
work afternoon lacking words to use  would like to have energy  challenge to go on 
cellphones are blinding  our eyes see only false light  look up and be free 
everlasting life  transcending above the cloud  password protected 
courage softens the  ground beneath intrepid feet  as we launch skyward 
you knew everything  transcendent presence of bliss  did you have to go 
i could leave my mark  anywhere in this city  but i choose this van 
as it envelops   carnivorous fog whispers   devour the light 
though once thought quite straight  rio oceania  brought scrunched tough sprawled shores 
what's left of the trees   howls beside the interstate   anxious men honk back 
a human being  seeking relevance becomes  a human doing 
take the cherokee  sell their life to bourgeoise  made now japaney 
hello mother moon   the tide swells at your behest   sleep well in your glow 
viceroy and monarch  mimic just by happenstance  me my own genus 
a great world so vast  to be plagued by cruelty  makes my young heart weep 
my master calls me  electronic sound commands  my shiny smartphone 
breezy summer night  where a lonely brave knight dances  betrayed by the star 
what we want often  won't reflect reality  sadly this is life 
spent my day alone  again i think about you  until tomorrow 
gentle thoughtful care   as dawn breaks so will she too   wounds nursed in the dark 
like two ships adrift  somehow we found each other  and saw the sunrise 
when your world goes gray   i will pinch your cheeks until   the red absolves you 
no nut november  some say it's a real challenge  lol vasectomy gang 
death will soon take you  and all of the ones you love  inevitably 
to define myself  ordinary ideas  into abstract love 
the gold sands of time  through delicate glass they fall  unique fall for all 
what is learned and made  revealing meaning in life  for humanity 
a crow caws softer  a hummingbird monkey bars  haunted dreams swingset 
the entrance of spring  reawakening the earth  sunlight sky a gift 
when effort leaves you  the way envelops all life  the current is swift 
graffiti obscured  nature reclaimed our old spot  my best friend is gone 
feelings can be hard  life is simpler without them  joy's a feeling too 
illuminating  the space between the stars  the silver moon sails 
i envy you thief  the moon must be delicious   judging by your grin 
the wind ripples clouds  on the waters glassy face  a duck chases bread 
crystal was displayed  but fell in shattered glass with  wind bumping the trees 
pounding head heart soul   lungs burn no end in sight   freedom in this pace 
trying times my friends  let contentedness sooth you  simple values true 
is a haiku re  ally just cutting words mid sen  tence to get the count 
scattered feathers betray  last night's passionate hunt  and now the fox sleeps 
together we hold   with steel balls and diamond hands   striving for the moon 
to women's libbers  don't strive for equality  strive to be greater 
now tipped upside down  a single grain a moment  the sands of time flow 
representatives  elected to speak for us  often prefer cash 
blankets on the ground  staring up at satellites  summer writes itself 
a sapphire orb  its frosted to perfection  i love blueberries 
beneath the night sky  golden embers giving warmth  marshmallows are burnt 
too quickly the words  love intended not given  rocky is the road 
laying on your back  underneath the glowing green  summer luxury 
gray sky snow falling   a lone chickadee's peeping   heard miles away 
ground shakes again in japan  everything destroyed again  tress don't seem to care 
friday the thirteenth   not a good day for most folks   superstitious swine 
a bite not enough  hunger rising  the flower elusive 
to heal my spirit  i must meditate at dawn  god give me the strength 
strutting his size the  flexing thunderhead had burst  into clapping bolts 
the summertime jazz   like salsa through sinuses   opens up spirits 
i sit my temper  down  in the cold mist 
last few nights in town  freedom from a draining clock  no holding back now 
cozy red couches  music from the old times  fully relaxed 
a birds morning song  a whistling in the wind  the world awakens 
i received your love  how short was the time we shared  till we meet again 
i fight for my right  and i live for the thrillers  just not all the time 
president moron  how could it have come to this  vote in november 
mosquitoes are huge   i feel like a blood donor   i need to lay down 
fog rolls through my mind  sluggishly i move about  a long day ahead 
i spotted a bird  it derailed my train of thought  i failed my classes 
fire and wind embrace  babes dancing to thunder's beat   wind carries the heat 
breezy is nudging  conifer conversations  whispering to sky 
in dark we make light  in silence we can make sound  in this world poems 
she screamed out oh god  i know she an atheist  she must not hate this 
try to be less of  a fucking piece of shit than  you were yesterday 
steep hill before us  friends together we will climb  god guides and provides 
marooned on an isle  with no chance of a rescue  his heart ached for her 
pushed out of the nest   now realizing i can fly   thank you for leaving 
you loved my green eyes  like a walk in the forest  now lost forever 
prance delightfully  then give me aids mightily  male ballerinas 
a cracked open cocoon   the butterfly stares at the endless landscape   from a cobweb 
accumulating debt  when the world doesn't end  i'll meet my maker 
on my tongue dreaming  as sparrows sing now in bloom  wishing star rise up 
shitty little poem  thanks for letting me hide my  quirky ugly thoughts 
darkness unfolding  plaques and tangles spreading wide  loved ones lose their minds 
bright summer sunshine  i own this day so divine  my choices are mine 
aches to give you up   fly with your beautiful wings   you were never mine 
warm rays touch skin  icy air stings as wind blows  sunny winter day 
as i receive praise  i grant myself confidence  yet remain humble 
vladimir putin  keeps his spare roubles in a  winnie the pooh tin 
a youthful car but  aging face with frazzled hair  rebelling the truth 
why seventeen  if it's short nobody gives  a damn haiku 
lying on her side  book in hand she scans the page  then turns to face me 
the first cup of tea  dusting away the cobwebs  waking up my mind 
envy and worry   permeate my thoughts today   though not productive 
like a living ghost  the old blind cat who follows  every sound i make 
overnight flight home  landing soon in amsterdam  patriotic eyes 
striking up the band  the twang of whining and the  sour notes of complaint 
i am in charge here  i volunteered for this job  please listen to me 
beginning to end  inevitable at hand  life goes on death comes 
shattered river ice  sews itself back together  scars replace her breasts 
times shared remembered  handing you to god's embrace  friend thanks for your love 
i find it freeing  the constraints of the format  eliminates waste 
out into the woods  a man searching for meaning  finds only himself 
just get me to work  you need new brakes yes i know  cold cold car please start 
unhindered carefree  sang the birds their joyful songs  despite the cold rain 
raindrops are falling  god is crying all night long  face hidden by clouds 
i feel emptied out   how'd i end up here anyone   a new lost spirit 
we were enemies  the pain brought us together  how are we so close 
tattoo studio  the talented artist works  a new butterfly 
we remember you  our tears like tears lost in rain  dear rutger hauer 
ink washing out blood  spirit stronger than the flesh  but not all survive 
humid city nights   continuously shuffling   of feet on asphalt 
if i am a tree  but your love is with the sea  make a ship of me 
two bathrooms enough  until smartphones turned toilets  into reading chairs 
is spring not just an   awakening of the earth   from the deepest dream 
a crow flew upwards  camouflaged in the dark clouds  thinking thunder song 
what happened to you  are you sure you're ok  blurred reality 
give your meat a tug  put it between some nice buns  enjoy some pulled pork 
lily pad playgrounds  amphibians hopscotching  to croaked hors d'oeuvres 
power cut  we reach mordor  by candlelight 
where are you now huh  the juliet left the romeo  didn't end the play 
you do not fear death  perhaps you are ignorant  enlighten yourself 
today's endless joy   chose to be a slow runner   rather than a slug 
spinning in circles  attempting to get things done  making easy hard 
i must not cannot  be alone when the freezing  snows of winter bite 
golden fall the leaves  may the sun shine on your path  and farewell she said 
it's all in our heads   infinite universes   and parallel worlds 
grey skies masked by clouds  light coming through still the sun's  bright requires no blue 
under an eclipsed sky   a new flower blooms   will it be first will it be last 
purrs vibrate my chest  mr rogers needs my warmth  human space heater 
pk fire from ness  you are trapped but must escape  got to di fast 
a cascade of light  sun beams peering through the clouds  reminders of hope 
pandemic had spread  it ain't death that i dread but  the words left unsaid 
once upon a time  at the end of a rainbow  miles found a trumpet 
i survived deadpool   you're not daredevil sorry   amused he spared me 
a taste of rye  a taste of rum  and a distaste of self 
rains bring pains again  but old scars will fade from skin  you are a good friend 
i just can't escape  trust me when i say i've tried  i won't forget you 
love in chaos  can you see it too  forever my thanksgiving 
there is another  beside you in the fire  you stand together 
all alone pitch black  in my bed the thoughts evolve  fiending for resolve 
pitch black and eerie  through the window silent night  but eyes stare both ways 
sweet dreams beckon me   but racing thoughts keep me chained   so i can't follow 
the icy wind blows  so much coldness towards me  can't react in kind 
beautiful flowers  chilly winds blow them away  swiftly life proceeds 
i had a dream once  joy sorrow triumph and loss  turns out it was life 
i miss that feeling  before you knew who i was  can we just go back 
two longing hearts met  remembering past lives lived  the two became one 
what are the chances  such as my circumstances  i need the answers 
some insomnia   i can dream my days away   and worry through nights 
the tallest flower  be it by chance or by fate  gets the most sunlight 
stems retreat the earth  a desperate climb for light  frozen yet flowing 
night has calmed the heat  shining moon guards the sky path  ghosts stir anxiously 
i'll never forget  running my hands through your hair  while you look at me 
you were everything  i shut you off i'm sorry  sunrise in her eyes 
the secrets you share  shall soon return to shame you  trust no one my friends 
laughter among friends  feelings circling in the air  dearest memory 
earth and sky melded  the binding that calls down rain  petrichor smell'd it 
my heart beats faster  your sweet smile brightens my day  when you pass by me 
the feeling has changed  from a sinkhole to a cave  a radiant void 
freedom is not free  through fall frost and spring we fought  summer will return 
the patter of rain  gusts of wind blow through my room  free for the moment 
plastic and gases  unnatural minerals  planet consumers 
the waves look beautiful   i know can do this   gotta avoid the rocks though 
somewhere in the world  someone is building a chair  someone else is dead 
cassandra's prophecy   the lemon flower is sweet   but the fruit of its is impossible to eat 
i miss you but i  don't miss you i love you still  but i don't like you 
no time left to spare  through an isolating time  silent they suffer 
oh crow in the field  fly away now fly away  into the future 
use efficient words  seven syllables go here  five for first and last 
steel mountain skyline  red lights flicker and twinkle  living city streets 
this girl is thirsty  and it's starting to show this  is not a good look 
fighting dont resolve  do not fight in life ever  love live do not hate 
one toe swims across  the pool's smooth surface shimmer  broken by crisp cracked skin 
drop falls after drop  reading the tracks of your tears  parallel poems 
dynasty of hate  a lineage of evil  beguiled by blood 
planes and trains arrive  an agreement yet to come  high road untraveled 
i am full of hate   hot yearning for things to end   let's kill each other 
on my tongue flutters  rain on rooftops a drainpipe  drunken thoughts insanity 
monochrome maiden  if you want to be happy  be sisyphus weeps 
i hate haikus  they do not even rhyme  how do they work 
got high holy veins  my reflection full of shame  i've been here too long 
to you everything  is a spider leg broken  off above the knee 
the dark sky of night  is illuminated by  the pale crescent moon 
upon the ocean  i labour for my future  one day it will come 
withered flowers cry  ringing ears distract the mind  asphyxiation 
it hasn't even  been a week since i lost you  i miss everything 
tears are a signal   they explain how far you reach   deep into my chest 
the scary things i see  are projections of the me  i don't want to be 
count love memories   everyone keeps something  the flame peace revenge 
see what's looking back   a welcome escape from all   wash the fear away 
i throw the dog's ball  into the lantana bush  petals everywhere 
stark cold gray hallway  body bags are near the morgue  but one starts to move 
an ecosystem  as vast as the amazon  in a box outside 
stringing pretty lights  their phosphorescent flash is  christmas in july 
cat's eyes filled with night  bright yellow moon lights the sky  the stars stream o'erhead 
tiny taps on earth  what a newfound background sound  to my lonely days 
surprise a challenge  obstacles with each step now  grace sought here it comes 
i've diabetes  that's not cash money of life  i've shidded my pants 
i echo father  so similar while alive  i hope not in death 
your life changed my life  god's love for us seen in you  ever loving you 
it is wings not rings  that entangle our souls and  weld us together 
like hidden termites  we only see their progress  when the house falls down 
from where comes the nerve  hey you can you stay inside  help flatten the curve 
deep the memories  currents of time so swift  loving our journey 
these people around me  freely breathing easily  why am i drowning 
july sixty nine  curious moths and street lamps  armstrong on the moon 
cloud tinted windows  with glass panes fogged by the ages  obscures scene with time 
a yawing freighter  rocking starboard and port is  bowing down to sleep 
i know just enough  to know that i don't know much  except i love you 
the bent willow tree  sheds its leaves into the stream  why are you weeping 
hours are ticking by  i check the clock once again  turns out only minutes 
getting zombie eyes  from being dead inside while  still being alive 
short eternities   my escape from kindred demons   silence no more lies 
morning espresso  accelerating the mind  and bowel alike 
anger can consume  white hot lava soon to cool  sadness just lingers 
not so serious  extravagant efforts fail  be like the water 
the afternoon winds  pushing the freshly risen sails  waking up stretching out 
haikus are easy   you just have to say some things  and count how many 
detached from myself  grounded by the ceiling i  suffocate in snow 
eyes start to water   impending sneeze incoming   i hate allergies 
the angel's cold tears  calls for the land's protector  but no one answers 
i'm very hungry  but am having too much fun  video games starve 
exam tomorrow  anxiety rolling in  paralyzing me 
focus clarity  daily my view is improved  such hints of wonder 
a warm lambent glow  peaking through shadowy bush  a new day to come 
sensing five fingers  each open understanding  xenial right now 
my head swims with emotion   your kisses do that   melt me again and again 
you are wearing me  out like a fashion statement  abuse is en vogue 
the birch tree waiting  with bare branches shivering  the nightingales song 
in the midnight hour  falling short and wandering  you broke through to me 
salt stains on suede shoes  sweaters soaked by soggy snow  winter's welcome wanes 
somewhere over the  rainbow way up high there's a  land that i've heard of  
sitting here with you   every sweeping glance you make   takes my breath away 
my cat weighed two stone  the humming birds remember  the branches she reached 
all the world's a stage   implying i have a part   but i have no script 
how do people still  make original haikus  you'd think we'd run out 
called to follow you  eyes on you is all it takes  all else fades away 
i can teach you everything   said the master  and said no more 
fairytale darkness  lingers on his lips music  pied pipers arrives 
the day continued  with no care of how i felt  my soul slowly died 
the thirst is the worst  when the sun fell down at last  i drank water first 
how many hipsters  to change a lightbulb it's a  small obscure number 
he did lose his aunt  does he see me as his friend  i care about him 
sharks are swimming in  an ocean of snow by his  dorsal fins of ice 
on a pale spring day  one rhinoceros beetle  feasting on fig tarts 
a cold wintry night  overcome by warm morning  with mighty purpose 
midnight still awake  while the rest of the house sleeps  i dread tomorrow 
don't paint the rainbow   it's colors are everywhere   experience it 
i tried on my mask  my mother sewed it by herself  once curtain fabric 
vibrations meet sand   the grains dance accordingly   illustrating sound 
god's hand see it now  reach out connect rise with joy  always there for you 
we breathe the same air  feeling the the same cool clean sheets  inside each other 
my time not wasted  pining for impossible  all it cost was hope 
seeking fellowship   as hard as it may become   destiny awaits 
a tale of brothers  saving people hunting things  supernatural 
freetime is freed time  it will flee you must hold it  and use it with care 
just got laid off work   since coronavirus sucks  surrounded by idiots 
draped in his own flag  the war removed everything  finally he's home 
you told me you were bad  my mistakes have taught me that  i should believe you 
destined to descend  leaving a path of silver  usher of winter 
partner still snoring  blankets pulled up to my chin  first dawn of the year 
one billion flashlights  shine down from the winter sky  onto sleeping tents 
the armored beetle   paddles through the reflection  climbs out and dives back 
i found you wilting  damn the sun i will hide you  but come back to life 
nothing left to give  like the final syllable  i disappear 
his balls were dangling  like the eternal apples of  the eternal tree 
you can see the scars  where the sharp words cut this line  into three pieces 
it finally sets  amongst the thin suffering clouds  oh where is my mind 
swift fat drops of rain   complimenting summers end   as autumn begins 
the park weekday nights  kids and dogs trample wet grass  last days of summer 
small conflict and yet  days of silence is better  than saying sorry 
melancholic mood  rain falls with sadness in bloom  every lie came true 
easily wounded  he sits and waits for something  that will never come 
i can't miss ever  i'm the motherfucking man  i will never miss 
in blueberry woods  yellow raincoat purple tongue  i breathe in the rain 
it was destiny  ship was born to die in sea  won't forget you jack 
water is dripping  echoing into a pan  driving me crazy 
castles in the sky  above blue ridge sentinels  bathed in golden hues 
they say make a wish  upon the first twilight star  already have you 
chitown musical  no words stop no words stop my  elevated train 
rough tattoo artist  talked about church of satan  one a m bar talk 
sneezing and sniffing  in cootie bug cubicles  partitioned our cold 
lunch break walks fill me   the flowers and dogs and kids   alas i head back 
the ice has melted  everywhere that i can see  except my garden 
kauaian coffee  steams my reading glasses  birds squirrels deer come say hi 
i sit on my chair  reliving the past  i cannot let go 
why yes i believe  that it was satan in me  gave me eyes to see 
if you are alone  just remember this haiku  and i'm there with you 
and to what extent  will these ceaseless dreams be lived  we all are waiting 
i love you for real   always know this love is real   because i am here 
when a good friend leaves  a piece of them still remains  forever with you 
my ass is heavy  it feels like anvil with legs  my ass really hurts 
sometimes i feel it  this my city of angels  is my only friend 
it comes once a year  so celebrate with a pie  it's three point one four 
pasty like raw dough  soft light downey flesh on mine  i love you pillow 
feeling stuck too long  seeking change in scenery  venture down new path 
all of my grieving  happened during the summer  so you wouldn't see 
i am in great pain  flashed before me a good life  i am now at peace 
i got high off your  fumes and chemicals and i  took too much too much 
i lie here in bed   wondering if all this dread   is just in my head 
poison on my lips  life starts to drain from my face  and you just smile 
cthulhu sees all  death and destruction shall come  he can not be stopped 
drink before you drive  things can go south really fast  be careful okay 
stargazing jumpers  adrift on quantum fables  filaments of fate 
i'm super stinky   to mosquitoes around me   i'm a smelly food 
living with regret  keep wishing i could go back  i should have kissed you 
i wish i was not  always so lonely while  standing in a crowd 
you appear charming  and careless but i know the  chaos that you hide 
silently she sings  a song of serene sadness  but she's just a rock 
held his cotton hand  and warmth flooded me stronger  than any other man 
an early snowfall  drains warmth from the flower pot  cat curls up in bed 
five seven and five  i could never count that well  why all that damn math 
words like a flower  convey more to the male soul  than a cow patty 
my rational side  rides shotgun windows down with  the radio on 
the way of rudolph  misfit finds friendship love home  red glow from inside 
brocaded clouds are  from the house of autumn and  dress a purple sky 
through thick and thin friends  there for you no matter what  i thought i had two 
insolence pervades  so reprimand my buttocks  don't spare the rattan 
tree branches shiver  squirrel silent in midair  tree branches shiver 
nett ish nett aber  schadenfreude schmecht mir gut  so süß wie honig 
heed this prophecy   we're all destined for greatness  learn to know thyself 
blinds melon eye  jungle juice choose  your green machine 
all up in yo' house  with my feet upon the couch  eff yo' couch biotch 
her name was karen  wanted to see her again  manager i have become 
to discourage mice  the kitchen is kept well cleaned  such orderliness 
calm and balanced thought  harmony follows the plot  good actor of life 
eyes are wide open  i scream unable to go back  irreversible 
dawn drips on the trees  ripples of black meet the eye  wind breathes relieved sigh 
invisible hand  that one finger you raise up  the poor clearly see 
a v then a j  geese cross the darkening sky  moon on the river 
how hard can it be  to string some words together   and call it haiku 
dear andromeda  you sit just within our grasp  yet so far away 
a sudden rush of   euphoria the fleeting   runner's high is here 
dead faces occupying my brain  i was too slow  my battle buddy is dead 
and when our lips met  we both remembered the sea   anchovy kisses 
i look in your eyes  and find my gaze drifting down  where your lips await 
french is retarded   french is the gayest language   now i want die 
don't let me say this  i love you for all you are  heart soul hands and smile 
the fog lingers low  dimming the colours of life  a monochrome cloak 
i slept like garbage  i should staple my eyes shut  sun won't shine anymore 
she tracks her gray ghost  footprints she believes too much  and i too little 
radiant fuzz ball  bursts to thousands with the wind  parachutes descend 
today i'm alone  tomorrow i have to work  though just as alone 
displaying patience  the spider waits for its prey  death gives way to life 
life is fleeting fast  memories slip as time flies  live with no regrets 
today a setback  your pain permeates my thoughts  why this path my lord 
the dough has risen  and soon the oven will yield  a warm loaf of bread 
chicken bacon ranch  oh that adds up to seven  would ya look at that 
psychedelia  underneath the green christmas  tree my friends love me 
walls can you hear me  the trees weren't talking either  everyone hates me 
huh huh huh huh huh   huh huh huh m huh huh m   huh huh m uh huh 
took a dandelion  for it to forgive herself  now she looks prettier 
start another day  i feel tired not worth it   start another day 
dead humming meadow  thorny vines constrict the oak  falls down the soldier 
a black paper moon  for me she destroyed the stars  our souls are forfeit 
i would love to know  what a hot pocket tastes like  without a burnt tongue 
face through misty glass  who is it a bell chimes back  crimson specks in snow 
we could never be  you were just a dream and i  was your fantasy 
maybe i'm a ghost   i hope we can spend more time  does it hurt so fine 
this sweet little hate  is but a fleeting feeling  greed burns within us 
daytime bathes us in light  light brings us the stress of life  we long for the darkness 
emphasis matters  say it in canadian  it's montessori 
the nights grow shorter  yet i remain in darkness  please turn the light on 
moving furniture  kills me as i save money  wawa overdose 
creative lifetime  now artifacts circulate  we make just to share 
once again such pain  slows me down but i endure  offered up for you 
atrium is full  aggressively shitting birds  a ruined new hat 
a man with no shoes  met a man who had no feet  and he was humbled 
the earth is dying  we're only getting older  listen to your heart 
the tide washes out  memories of us both here  tracks gone from the sand 
pain inside my chest  another one down the hatch  crying out to god 
i don't belong here  noone is the same as me  i must be myself 
chatting on my phone   like i have nothing to do  but to talk with you 
i must clean my room  my cellphone beckons to me  scroll and see and like 
faith hidden within  listenhear looksee believe  he does it for you 
been more then a year  everyone says to move on  i fucking miss you 
glowing horizon   sun emerges from the trees  elation of birds 
anniversaries  today makes fifteen for us  that's sixty seasons 
the carnivore blues  sink into lenten mush with  aching incisors 
saw you in a dream  and said we really have to  stop meeting like this 
there are things i knew  but i no longer know them  brain leaks still not fixed 
us through thick and thin  of late times a bit thinner  but love lays plenty 
where is my haiku  i know i posted it here  oh look six upvotes 
don't fuck with someone  else's feelings because you're  unsure about yours 
with father imbued  the son rises each morning  guided by spirit 
my poop smells awful   i should go to the doctor   or stop eating eggs 
potent sleeping pills  medically induced rest  yet i cannot dream 
share meeple castles  creative seven letters  always pick tiles first 
it stores food in cold  as to prevent rot and mold  refrigerator 
three soar   blackfeathered their circle   below dirty heavens 
lusting for water  i reach into my backpack  oops ten miles left 
did you guys know that  reddit has a haiku bot  it must love this sub 
cornucopias  thin white vertical incense  first honeysuckles 
i notice the heat  a lonely light flickering  surviving the night 
you loved horror   chocolate chip pancakes we shared   diabetes came 
everything is black  i just want to be happy  it will never be 
life weighs heavy a  long way ahead steep it goes  yet it glows golden 
oyster world limits  unwillingly bound to earth  yearning for the stars 
invisible strings  are attached to all of us  and all tangled up 
poised on the platform  her swam dive in trees with the  bridge as a spring board 
haikus help me think  momentary concise thoughts  sealed with a ribbon 
clouds shredded by wind  wet feet for man in the moon  willows still weeping 
dwelling in a vowel  and a scrubby consonant  spelling out sparrows 
truth proclaimed lived  an example for us all  fueling my hope 
a duel of the leaves   both are promptly defeated   the snow covers them 
mods removing posts   is reminiscent of days   gone by book burnings 
an otter went down  into the glassy water  to catch her breakfast 
do not waste your time  and know that without failure  you cannot improve 
begging my way back  another night on this road  i gaze at the moon 
keep this in your mind  only after the clouds cry  will the rainbow come
